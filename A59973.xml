            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE various and different Reports and Opinions of Men concerning the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> are not unknown in this part of the World, Some Perſons affirming that the Mines are not worth the working; that the Stock is all ſpent; and that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking is totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: Others again, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Falſity of theſe Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions run into another Extream, and pleaſe themſelves with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb facs="tcp:101819:3"/>of a ſpeedy return of Mountains of Treaſure beyond all reaſon or poſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that though the Mines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would be the beſt and most proper Argument to convince the former of their Error, yet the publiſhing of this Diſcourſe may be most uſeful and convenient for the latter, whoſe Intereſt ought not to be neglected, as being true Friends to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking.</p>
            <p>And indeed, 'tis pity the fair Adventurer ſhould be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Stock-jobbing or deſigning Perſons on one ſide, and ſo ſell out to loſs; or that he ſhould deceive
<pb facs="tcp:101819:3"/>himſelf with too great and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Expectations of bringing the <hi>Mines</hi> to the higheſt Valuation on the other ſide, and ſo (at any time) buy in too dear.</p>
            <p>A prudent Moderation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Extreams is always best; and to bring Men to this Temper is the Aim and Intent of Communicating this following <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> to the World, whereby the meanest Capacities or Perſons leaſt acquainted with <hi>Mineral Works</hi> will better underſtand the Nature of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, together with the preſent State and Condition of the <hi>Mines,</hi> and conſequently make a better Judgment of the Value of them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101819:4"/>
            <p> And that this is the proper Time of giving an Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will plainly appear when it is alſo conſidered, that there is good Reaſons given to induce any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man to believe, that it will not be very long before the <hi>Croſs-Drifts</hi> from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels will be carried home to the great <hi>Vein,</hi> as well as to all the rest; and then, as it will be too late to ſave thoſe Partners who ſhall be inveigled to ſell out to Diſadvantage for want of a true Information; ſo it may not be ſo well taken at that Time to leſſen the high Expectations of others, as it may be now, by preparing them for it.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, it muſt
<pb facs="tcp:101819:4"/>be confeſſed, That it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Concern for the Honour of our Native Country, as well as Admiration at the Thing it ſelf, obſerved, that any part of Mankind can read over the <hi>Liſt</hi> of the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> to the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> and yet at the ſame time believe, that all thoſe Noble Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all thoſe Reverend and Learned Biſhops and Divines, ſo many ingenious and induſtrious Merchants and Lawyers, (and many of them particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mineral Works) ſhould all engage in one Body, and with one Mind, in ſuch an <hi>Adventure,</hi> without a good Foundation for it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101819:5"/>
            <p> And therefore if any thing can be ſaid to open the Eyes of the World, and to make this <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking</hi> better underſtood, it ought not to be delayed on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever, tho' there were no other reaſon for it, but to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Adventurers therein at home, and the Judgment and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>EngliſhNation</hi> abroad.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, 'tis humbly hoped that when this familiar Diſcourſe is read over, the <hi>beſt part</hi> of Mankind will entertain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opinion of the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> and whatever the Succeſs ſhall be, will be able
<pb facs="tcp:101819:5"/>to juſtifie both the Prudence and good Intention of all their Freinds who have engaged in this <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,</hi> with as good or better Reaſons then ever any Company of Merchants could give for freighting a Ship to Sea, or expecting its ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. And as for all the reſt of our degenerate Race, that the honeſt Adventurer will be pleaſed to paſs by the Common Failing of every one of thoſe uſeleſs Criticks, with only this, or ſome ſuch Remark.</p>

            <p>IF any Perſons ſhall object againſt the publiſhing ſo long a Diſcourſe on this Subject, they are anſwered by the Intent thereof, <hi>which is ſincerely to do good to others, not to gain the leaſt Applauſe for the thing it ſelf,</hi> and to inform ſuch as are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Matters of this Nature, and not the Learned and Experienced Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. And for this Reaſon 'twas not thought convenient to omit any thing on this occaſion that might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the meanest Adventurer, tho' it put the Publiſher to the trouble of an <hi>INDEX</hi> on that Account, that any Perſon may readily turn to ſuch particular Matters as he conceives to be of greateſt Moment, without reading over the whole Diſcourſe.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Short Abſtract of the preſent ſtate of the Mines, by order of the Committee, and therein (amongſt other things) that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> had given a fair and juſt Account of the Mines. That four Veins did appear to bear Oar at the Surface of the Ground, ſome nine Inches, and ſome a foot thick, and that the reſt were left quick and rich in Oar, as Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> had deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: That they had a good proſpect of a rich Copper Vein: That <hi>Curtis Drift</hi> was carried home to the <hi>Bogg-Veine,</hi> which is four foot wide, and did ſet well, and widen downwards, and that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> was raiſing Oar there. That great Smelting and Refining-Houſes, a Key, a Canal of Three hundred yards in length, a Crane, and other Conveniencies were erected, and made at <hi>Neath,</hi> without any preſent Charge to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. That they had found by Experience, in large quantities, that the preſent Profit above all Charges from every Tun of Oar, was Five pounds and upwards: That the principal Stock was not leſſened above Two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds twelve ſhillings and four pence: That the Committee did believe they were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a very profitable Undertaking; and that they had demonſtrated their Opinion by their
<pb facs="tcp:101819:7"/>Actions, having purchaſed, ſince the Drawing, to the value of Eight thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty five pounds in Blank Tickets, and alſo Two hundred forty two ſhares. See the Abſtract.</p>

               <p>On my word, this is a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Paper. I know ſeveral of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Committee very well, they are Men of undoubted Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; Certainly they would not print and publiſh any thing that was not really true. I am ſurprized to ſee ſuch a Paper.—I proteſt I have heard this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſo ridiculed by the Wits of the Town, that I could not imagine there was any thing in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, my Lord, I ſhould not have credited, even this Paper, but that your Lordſhip gives ſo good a Character of the Committee.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>They are not only Perſons of great Honeſty, and not to be byaſs'd by any manner of Influence, but ſome of them have a conſiderable Eſtate in Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Works, which they do manage to good Profit and Advantage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I don't know any Perſons more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101819:10"/>in every reſpect to make a right Judgment of theſe Mines than they.

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if the Merchants and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy agree together in a Venture, it muſt needs be ſucceſsful. But I cannot well conceive how this Reverend Doctor came

               <p>My Lord, if I have erred in this Particular, I am ſorry for it; but I muſt beg leave to aſſure your Lordſhip, that it was not out of greedy Lucre of Gain, or of a Fortunate Lot, but ſome other Reaſons that prevailed with me, which perhaps may have very little weight or Credit with many other Perſons, and therefore I ſhall not trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall not preſs any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your Inclinations, Sir: But if I may be free on this occaſion, I confeſs, that if I were to venture my Money in a Lottery, it ſhould be in hopes of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>I don't ſay, my Lord, but that a Fortunate Lot is a very acceptable thing; but yet if I had been ſure to have had none, I would have ventured in this as much as I did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I never knew a Perſon of your Coat ſo fond of a Lottery before; I hope you'l pardon me, Sir, that I am ſo free with you, for it is your own Diſcourſe that is the cauſe of it, which to me ſeems really to want an Interpreter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you have put ſo hard upon me, that your Lordſhip now forces
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101819:11"/>me to ſay ſomething more than I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My Lord, I am not fond of that thing called a Lottery in general; but on the contrary, am very glad that all common Gaming Lotteries are ſuppreſſed. But I humbly conceive—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, The drawing of Lots (with ſubmiſſion) is not <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> nor any ways Scandalous in its own Nature; or elſe your Lordſhip would never have concurred to introduce the Precedent of the <hi>Million Lottery.</hi> That which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Wiſdom of the King, Lords, and Commons aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, can never bear a Reflection on the Wiſdom of a private Perſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>What you ſay is true. Neither are we angry at the thing it ſelf, as you may obſerve by the Favour ſhewed to the <hi>Greenwich-Hoſpital Adventure;</hi> but Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries have been generally abuſed ſince that time to ill purpoſes, and many of them not fairly drawn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>There are many other things that have been abuſed to ill purpoſes, as well as the Drawing of Lots; as to give your Lordſhip one Inſtance for all: What does your Lordſhip think of the Law of <hi>England?</hi> Has not that Law, the beſt Law in the World, been abuſed to ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? And what Anſwer is made to that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101819:12"/>Objection but this? That in ſuch Caſes it is <hi>vitium hominis, non profeſſionis;</hi> and there its agreed that ſuch Abuſes by Men ought to be reſtrained and regulated, but without the leaſt Reflection, nay indeed with a tacit Commendation of thoſe that make a right uſe of the Law, that do act fairly, and have the Right on their ſide. And this I conceive to be our Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay well, if your Lottery was fairly drawn to the Satisfaction of all Perſons concerned, and not abuſed to any ill purpoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, as to the fairneſs of Drawing, I muſt beg leave to acquaint your Lordſhip, that the <hi>Mine-Adventure</hi> is allowed to exceed all, (and with due ſubmiſſion be it ſpoken) even the <hi>Million Lottery</hi> it ſelf. For though (without doubt) the <hi>Million Lottery,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) were very fairly drawn, yet the <hi>Mine-Adventure</hi> Tickets being Subſcribed with the <hi>Parties own Hand-writing</hi> (which no others were) did not only prevent Fraud, but all Miſtakes which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened when the Party depended on the Number of the Tickets only! But here the <hi>Names</hi> of the Adventurers being read as well as the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the Tickets, and Regiſtred by two Clerks on Oath, <hi>as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101819:12"/>well Blanks as Prizes,</hi> one corrected the other, that if the number of the Ticket was miſtaken, as it often happen'd, in <hi>printing, reading,</hi> or <hi>entring,</hi> yet the Name of the Adventurer writ thereon was always right, and could not be miſtaken, and certainly nothing in nature could be more fair; and indeed all Perſons concerned have ſo acknowled'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That was exceeding fair indeed, and beyond all manner of Exception. But what ſay you to the other part of my Lord's Objection, Was not the Drawing of Lots in this Caſe abuſed to ill purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, with ſubmiſſion I conceive, if ever the Drawing of Lots was allowable, it was in this Caſe: For this was not in the nature of a common Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Lottery, where the Undertaker was to have ſo much <hi>per Cent.</hi> out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney adventured, ſince no Perſon gained a Farthing by this Adventure more than another, unleſs by having better Fortune. But ſeveral Gentlemen being concerned as Partners in a Mine, and being entangled with many Difficulties and Law-ſuits, and knowing no other way to reconcile their Differences, did agree together to the Drawing of Lots. This was Neceſſity, not Choice, and ſeems to be juſtified by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101819:13"/>the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> where one of the Ancient Diviſions by Daughters and Heirs, as Copartners, is by Drawing of Lots. And this puts me in mind of a pleaſant Story I have heard of a Grand Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> who upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the War, obtained to be a Judge of a certain Province, where he behaved himſelf very well; and being commanded by the King to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how he was able to manage and give Satisfaction to ſo great a Province, being not bred up to the Law. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and declared, that there were three ſorts of Cauſes that came before him: Some were ſo plain and evident, that any Man on hearing Counſel on both ſides, might eaſily determine them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being more difficult, and a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Martial Underſtanding, he took time to conſider of; and after ſome Converſation with the Advocates on both ſides, he diſcovered who had the Right in ſuch Cauſes. But there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo very Nice and Difficult, that though he took a long time to conſider of them, and his Bottles of Hermitage and Flasks of Champagn flew about like Lightning amongſt the Advocates, yet he could never get the Counſel on either ſide to yield, but they ſtill pleaded with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101819:13"/>Zeal, (in private as well as publick) for their reſpective Clients. Well, ſays the King, and what did you do then? The Marſhal was very unwilling, yet being forced to it, did confeſs that he had no other way in that Caſe, but to retire into his Cloſet, and to throw Dice fairly on the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>Now for the Plaintiff, Now for the Defendant.</hi> On my word (ſays the King) Thou art the moſt juſt Judge I have in all my Dominions; Go on and proſper.</p>
               <p>So theſe Gentlemen being engaged in a very difficult Cauſe, and fearing their Leaſe of the Mines would expire before their Suit in <hi>Chancery</hi> would be ended, (the Counſel on both ſides being very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in their Opinion for their reſpective Clients;) they thought fit to ſubmit to the Drawing of Lots, as being the only way left to raiſe a Stock, reconcile all Differences, and ſet the Mines on work. And is there any hurt in all this?</p>

               <p>No certainly; all Mankind muſt allow that the Drawing of Lots in ſuch a Caſe was very allowable. But ſtill I would fain know the Reverend Doctor's Reaſons for his great Zeal in this matter; for we have interrupted his Diſcourſe all this while.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this worthy Gentleman has prevented a great part of my Defence, and in much more diverting Terms than I could pretend to. But yet, my Lord, I muſt ſtill own, I had other Reaſons for my Engaging in this Affair. But—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt then declare, that I was not only ſatisfied that the Drawing of Lots was lawful, ſince we find in Sacred Writ, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> divided the Land to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Caſting of Lots; and that Lots were drawn in the Choice of an Apoſtle; and alſo that it was abſolutely neceſſary in this Caſe, for the Reaſons aforeſaid. But I was farther ſatisfied, that this Lottery was at firſt contrived with a very good Deſign, not only to Reconcile all Differences amongſt the Partners, and ſet on work ſo great a Mine for the Publick Good, and employ great Numbers of poor Workmen, their Wives and Children; but alſo thereby to enable the firſt Contriver thereof to Carve out of the Mines a very Great and Noble Share for Charitable Uſes, which could not in all probability have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any other means. This, my Lord, was the Reaſon that induced me to engage in this Undertaking: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed, that this very thing was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101819:14"/>the Occaſion that many Perſons refuſed to be concerned in it, pretending that the Undertaking was entangled (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it) with ſo great a Charity, I thought it became every good Man to give a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand to it, not only to bring this particular Undertaking to good Effect, but by the Succeſs of this, to encourage all other Perſons concerned in Mineral Works, to follow ſo good an Example; and to ſet apart ſome Share of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof to Charitable Uſes, if it were only to the Relief of ſuch poor Miners, their Wives and Children, as may in time ſtand in need thereof. And ſince, my Lord, all this Good may be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being one of the Committee for the Management of the Mines, or being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the Duty of our Function by any Temporal Care or Concern in this Affair, I humbly hope that none of my Coat have any reaſon to be aſhamed of promoting ſo good an Undertaking.</p>

               <p>My Lord, there is a Twelfth part of the Profits of all theſe Mines appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to Charitable Uſes, which I take to be a competent Share thereof, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101819:15"/>being placed in good Hands, may conduce very much to the promoting of many Great and Noble Deſigns in the World; As for the Augmentation of poor Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges in <hi>Wales;</hi> for the Aſſiſtance and Encouragement of ſuch Perſons as ſhall Endeavour the Converſion of Infidels in the <hi>Indies;</hi> for Relief of <hi>Greenwich</hi> and other Hoſpitals; of poor Miners and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers at the Works, their Wives and Children, and in time, of other poor People in moſt of the Great Corporations in the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>My Lord, that Caſe ſtands thus: Sir <hi>H.

But that is now alter'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101819:16"/>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Doctor, I think it was very well intended; How came it to paſs that ſo good a Deſign was alter'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the old Partners, who had an Election, whether they would take Money for their Shares, or Subſcribe to this New Undertaking, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that by ſuch a Diſpoſition, all thoſe Corporations would have an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Government and Management of the Mines; and not knowing what might be the Conſequence of ſuch a thing, did abſolutely refuſe to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> unleſs Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> would alter that Deſign; and thereupon after many long Debates about it, and Conſultation had with ſome Learned Divines, it was agreed, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Ten thouſand pounds in Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, the Poor ſhall have a Twelfth part of the Profits of all theſe Mines, clear of all manner of Charges; and that the ſame ſhall be diſpoſed by Sir <hi>H.

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Then it is in Effect the ſame thing as it was before, only the Charity is changed from a Caſual Profit to an Annual ſtanding Revenue for the Poor, which I think is much more equal: But pray, Sir, is there any thing yet given to Charitable Uſes?</p>

               <p>There is ſo; but that is but a ſmall Matter, erected on the Credit of this Undertaking: I hope in due time to ſee great Things accompliſhed by the Aid of this Charity.</p>

               <p>If there be ſo much good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as you expreſs, I admire this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſhould be cried down as it is, by ſome Perſons.</p>

               <p>My Lord, The Reaſon of that may be, for that of late Years, there hath been ſeveral Projects ſet on foot, which have either proved unſucceſsful, or which is worſe, meer Cheats, and the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mankind, ſeldom Enquire into the Merits of a Cauſe, but argue, from what has been in another Cauſe, to what may be in this.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>But that is not fair Arguing, for every Cauſe ſtands upon its own Bottom. If the Judges of the Land ſhould follow that method, without making Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they would make mad work in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall.</hi>

               <p>True, my Lord; but they are too wiſe to fall into ſuch an Error. We are ſpeaking of another ſort of People, who never allow themſelves time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider any thing, much leſs to make any Differences or Diſtinctions; and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind being naturally inclin'd to Satyr and Envy, one malicious or deſigning Perſon ſhall ſpread a falſe Report in Town, which will ſoon be believed by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch Inconſiderate Perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Enquiry into the Truth of the Fact.</p>

               <p>My Lord, there is no Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo Good, ſo Charitable, or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Publick, but ſome private Perſons may be prejudiced by it; and in this Caſe it's certain there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons, who think themſelves very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101819:17"/>much concerned in Intereſt againſt this Undertaking; but I forbear to name any, becauſe I conceive they are under a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and I will not make the Difference wider than it is.

               <p>My Lord, we ought to do ſo; but I confeſs I cannot ſay we always do what we ought. But is there any great hurt in this? to buy when a Commodity is cheap, and ſell when it is dear.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>

               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is hard to make a Man of Honour and Pleaſure a Man of Buſineſs: I hope your Lordſhip will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this Freedom; for all our General Rules have Exceptions; I may give a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101819:18"/>good Rule, and yet your Lordſhip may be miſtaken, and then I ſhall be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>No, good Sir, it it is better to walk by ſome Rule than none at all: Give me your General Rule, and if I don't apply it well, let the Fault lye at my door.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then my Lord, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule that all old Merchants on the <hi>Exchange</hi> do take, is this; Firſt they obſerve whether a New Undertaking be founded on a real Subſtantial Thing, or on a meer Notion; if the Project be only Notional, they ſeldom venture; and thoſe that do, ſeldom ſucceed. But if there be a Staple, or other real Subſtantial Commodity in the Caſe, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is brought to bear, then they watch the firſt Opportunity when it is cried down, and buy in; and when all the World is mad, and run it up into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Extream, then they ſell out, and ſo take the next Opportunity to buy in cheap again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>O, is that your way of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Now we at the other end of the Town do think, that when a Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fall, then the Undertaking falls too; but when the Stock riſes, then it is a good Thing, and we lay out our Money in it.</p>
            </sp>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101819:18"/>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>But we generally think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: For nothing is more common, than for the ſame Man to ſell a few Shares cheap, in order to buy in a great many more at the ſame price. And ſo on the contrary, ſeveral Perſons will Combine together to buy a few Shares at a high price, when they really intend to ſell out.</p>

               <p>This is a pretty Trade indeed. How ſhall a Man do at this rate to be at any certainty?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Every Perſon has a very plain Rule to walk by in this Caſe, if he will but take the trouble to follow it.</p>

               <p>Really, my Lord, a Man would think ſo: But yet there are ſome Perſons that are either ſo very full of Buſineſs, or very Lazy, that they will rather take things as they find them on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> then go as far as <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> to know the Truth.</p>

               <p>True, my Lord: For many other Companies perhaps ſubſiſt upon Credit, but this upon a ſubſtantial Foundation; the leſs others, and the more we are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the greater eſteem will be had both for them and us.</p>

But, my Lord, to tell you the truth, we have the ſame common Frailties amongſt us in that part of the World that you have in this; and there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101819:19"/>are Parties and Factions there, as well as here, and we ſpeak according to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we eſpouſe, or the Intereſt we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in; but this never does no hurt amongſt us, for we know one anothers Humours, and therefore never mind what either Party ſays, but enquire into the truth of the Fact, and ſtick to that.</p>

               <p>I have heard ſeveral good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given, why Men ſpeak againſt this Undertaking; Becauſe it is their private Intereſt, or Policy to do ſo; or becauſe they don't underſtand any thing of the Matter, and being prepoſſeſſed with an ill Opinion of all Things that look like Projects, will not give themſelves the trouble to diſtinguiſh, or to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But yet I fancy there may be another Reaſon aſſigned, why one ſort of Men ſpend their Wit upon it.</p>

               <p>Pray Doctor, what is that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, 'tis a little out of the common way of Reaſoning; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether it may be ſo proper at this time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Doctor, be free; Let us have your Opinion without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

               <p>My Lord, ſince you command it, I will be free. And firſt, I muſt obſerve to your Lordſhip, that all the World is divided into two Parties, <hi>The good and the bad;</hi> not but that the beſt Men have ſome Failings, and the worſt Men ſome good Qualities: But I mean by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that the World is divided into Men who are chiefly governed by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101819:20"/>Suggeſtions and Influences of a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Men who are governed by thoſe of an evil one.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I infer thus much; that as there is in every Man, (who is a little World within himſelf) an Inteſtine War between the Fleſh and the Spirit; the one inclining him to do good, and the other to do evil; ſo there is in the great World a perpetual War and Oppoſition between thoſe two Parties above-mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, Doctor, what's all this to the Oppoſition that is made to the <hi>Mine-Adventure?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I acquainted your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that my preſent Conception was a little out of the common Road of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and am afraid I ſhall tire your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>No; pray Doctor go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Inference then (in ſhort) is no more but this, That if this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be well deſigned; if ſo noble a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is well intended, and likely to take effect, as I verily believe it will; 'tis no wonder that one of thoſe Parties ſhould violently oppoſe it; for the Prince of this World has an abſolute power over his Subjects; and though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101819:21"/>wicked Men think themſelves free, yet they are really meer Slaves: They have liſted themſelves as his Soldiers, and ſo long as they continue in his Service, they muſt fight his Battles whether they will or no. A Government by an Earthly Prince is outward and viſible; but a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a Spirit is inward and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and yet the latter is much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; for the former only governs the outward Man, but the latter the very Heart and Affections; and certainly who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever governs the Thoughts of a Man, and his very Heart and Affections, governs the Man himſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That is certain indeed. But do you really believe that this Charity will prove ſo conſiderable a thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I'le ſuppoſe that theſe Mines ſhould not come near the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Steward, I'le go as low as ever I heard any Perſon, and ſuppoſe that the Mines ſhould not yield above a fourteenth part of the Steward's Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no Man of ſenſe ever doubted, yet even in that Caſe there would be a thouſand pounds a Year to Charitable Uſes, my Lord, this ſeems no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thing; ſuch a Sum well applied e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, may contribute to do no ſmall good in the World.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>It is not to be deſpiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>But then my Lord, give me leave to ſuppoſe on the other hand, what I hope this Gentleman will be able to prove, That it is not impoſſible, but that the Mines in time may anſwer even the Steward's higheſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; and if that ſhould happen, there would be above Twelve thouſand pounds every Year applied to Charitable Uſes. What a noble Thing would this be! Ought not ſuch a Deſign to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged? or at leaſt entertained in the World with favourable Thoughts. A good Man would not raſhly condemn any thing of this Nature, but would at leaſt ſuſpend his Judgment for a ſeaſon, concluding with himſelf, that if this thing were a Cheat, two or three Years time would fully diſcover it; but if it be a good thing, why ſhould we raſhly and haſtily engage againſt it?</p>

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Doctor, you have ſaid a great deal in this Matter, which deſerves to be conſidered; and I confeſs I am ſo far convinced, that I can ſee no reaſon to judge but that the <hi>Mine-Adventure</hi> may be a profitable and good Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, notwithſtanding the Oppoſition it has met with by ſome Perſons in the World. Thus much I can ſay for it,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101819:22"/>That in the little Experience I have had, I generally found, that the beſt Deſigns have met with the greateſt Oppoſition; but I confeſs, I could never give any good Reaſon for it before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>This Diſcourſe has really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd a great Myſtery to me, for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I could not underſtand why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reverend Fathers and Doctors of the Church had engaged in this Adventure; nor why the Undertaking it ſelf was ſo much cried down by ſome Perſons?

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt beg leave to add this one thing more; That though this Undertaking be ſo much cried down by one Party, yet it is as much cried up by the other, and I hope with much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Truly I begin to be of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. But pray Doctor, give me leave to be a little more inquiſitive in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I don't pretend to underſtand any thing of Mines; I have only preſum'd to lay before your Lordſhip the Reaſons that induced me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them; <hi>I really believe that this is an honeſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, and well deſign'd;</hi> but I muſt leave the reſt to this worthy Gentleman, who may perhaps be capable

            </sp>

               <p>My Lord, I muſt confeſs I have taken ſome pains to be rightly inform'd in this Matter, as became me to do, and as far as my Capacity extends, ſhall be ready to give your Lordſhip any farther Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard that though you may raiſe great quantities of Oar, yet your Oar is ſo very hard and poor, that it will turn to no Profit, the Charges of Smelting is ſo great, and the yield of the Oar ſo little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>That Objection was formerly made, but is long ſince vaniſhed; ever ſince the ſeveral ſorts of Oar were tried publickly in <hi>Stationers-Hall,</hi> at a General Meeting of the Partners; which was done with that Exactneſs, as gave every Perſon entire Satisfaction, and I thought 'twas impoſſible for that Objection ever to be ſtarted again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your pardon, Sir, I did not hear what produce thoſe Trials yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>The three ſeveral ſorts of Oar were brought into the Hall in a Trunk, with Partitions; and the Oars were firſt tried ſeverally by themſelves, and afterwards jointly together; and the pooreſt Oar
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101819:23"/>yielded about two Thirds in Lead, and the beſt about three Fourths. I deſire any Perſon to ſhew a large Vein richer than this in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>But how did it appear that the Oar tried in <hi>Stationers-Hall,</hi> was the Oar from thoſe Mines?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>The Adventurers ſent for a Ship-loading of Lead and Oar, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have a fair Trial in large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that they might be at a certainty in this Particular, and the Workmen below made Affidavit, That the Lead and Oar put on Board the Ship called the <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Deſire, Thomas Friend</hi> Maſter, at <hi>Abcrdavoy,</hi> was the Produce of the Mines of <hi>Bwlch-Yr-Eskyr-hyr;</hi> and the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made Affidavit that he brought the ſame Oar to the Port of <hi>London;</hi> and the Maſter of the Wharf there proved, that he took that very Oar out of the ſaid Veſſel, and brought it to the ſaid Hall, where it was immediately tried.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>That was exceeding fair and full proof indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>But beſides, the Committee have anſwered that Objection very fully in their printed State of the Mines; for there they acquaint us that they make ſive pounds and upwards of every Tun of Oar, one with another, and in large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101819:23"/>over and above all manner of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whatſoever; which I think, my Lord, is a very great Profit, and the fineſt Trade in the World, if the Mines hold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs I think it is a prodigious Profit: But are you ſure they don't miſtake?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, I have ſeen the Trials, and the Original Entries in their Books at large; and I am ſatisfied that the clear Profits at preſent, is above Six pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, but I commend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to ſet it down very cautiouſly, for fear any Accident ſhould happen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by the fall of the Price of Lead, or of Lytharge, or the like, for which they ought to make an Allowance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>This Anſwer has prevented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Doubt, Whether their Lead be good or not? For if they make ſo much Profit, their Lead muſt needs be a good Commodity; though I confeſs I have heard that their Lead was brittle, and fit for no other uſe but to make Bullets or Shot; and that the Oar was ſo poor, it was not poſſible to make better Lead with it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>This Objection ariſes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the unskilfulneſs of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that makes it; for hard or poor Oar ſmelted by a skilful Artiſt, will make as good Lead, though not as much in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as rich Oar; but there is indeed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101819:24"/>more Art and Skill in the doing of it, and many Perſons that are uſed to ſoft Oars, do not underſtand the right way of Smelting hard Oars, which has been the occaſion of this miſtake. But, my Lord, this Objection has alſo vaniſhed a long time ago, ever ſince we made the ſaid Trials, and produced our Lead on the Key of <hi>London;</hi> and yet that Lead was not made by the moſt skilful Artiſt; for the Lead we now make is beyond that, being exceeding tuff, and fit for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of uſes: But at preſent, till greater quantities of Oar ſhall be raiſed, we do for the moſt part ſell our Lead in a ſort of a Powder, called <hi>Lytharge.</hi>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, good <hi>Lytharge</hi> was never made a Merchantable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in <hi>England,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Robert Lydall,</hi> Chief Operator to the Company, made the Diſcovery, for which he hath a Patent from his preſent Majeſty.</p>

               <p>True, my Lord; the <hi>Potters</hi> finding no ſort of <hi>Lytharge</hi> made fine and clean enough for their purpoſe, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with great Care, Trouble, and Charge to Calcine the Lead themſelves, or by continual ſtirring in an Iron Kettle, to make it into a Courſe Powder, which they ground fine at the Mill, and ſo mixed it with other proper Ingredients, and made it fit for the Glazing Trade. But, my Lord, in this way of making, the Fumes are very unhealthy to the Men, and the Operation chargeable to the Maſter; ſo our <hi>Lytharge</hi> is not only much finer and better for their uſe, but cheaper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>

               <p>Red-lead is frequently mixed with Duſtand Aſhes, and often adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Red-oaker and Brick-duſt; but this <hi>Lytharge</hi> is always made pure, without either Duſt or Aſhes mixed with it. And it is obſerved, that the Glaſs made with this <hi>Lytharge</hi> is much finer, more white and clear; and which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Advantage, is not ſo apt to crack when cold, as Glaſs made with Red-lead is; which is more burnt in the fire than <hi>Lytharge,</hi> and ſo more ſhort and brittle in its Nature and Uſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Then it is much better indeed: But how is it cheaper?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>Lytharge</hi> goes farther than Red-lead, which is a Compound, and has Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mixed with it, and all that is added to the Lead it ſelf, is uſeleſs to the <hi>Glaſs-makers,</hi> and either conſumes, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates in the fire; ſo that Twenty hundred
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101819:26"/>of this fine <hi>Lytharge</hi> will make near Two and twenty hundred of Red-lead; and as has been obſerved, <hi>Lytharge</hi> not being ſo much burnt in the fire, but being of a much ſofter nature than Red-lead, ſooner and at leſs Charge melteth again in the fire, and mixeth better with the Sand and Aſhes, uſed by the <hi>Glaſs-makers</hi> to their great Advantage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Then indeed if you ſell the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge</hi> at the price of Red-lead, it has an apparent Advantage.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this <hi>Lytharge</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ſold at above Twenty pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, but now the Company, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make it an Univerſal Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all the World for thoſe Uſes, are content to ſell it near the price of Red-lead, which is the reaſon that I aſſerted it was cheaper, as well as better, for the uſe of the <hi>Glaſs-makers.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, they do, and agree theſe Facts above-mentioned; but, this is yet a new thing, and I can't tell whether all of them know the uſe of it or not; nor whether all are ſo ingenuous as to confeſs the Truth, becauſe they may apprehend that it may raiſe the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord A.</speaker>
               <p>You have opened my Eyes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in this Matter; for I really thought the <hi>Lytharge</hi> that you ſeem ſo much to depend on, could have but little vent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Though I have ſaid ſo much of the Nature and Uſe of <hi>Lytharge,</hi> and conſequently have proved the great vent of it, yet, my Lord, I muſt alſo inform your Lordſhip, that we never depended ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much on the vent of our <hi>Lytharge.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>No! what would you do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we can make Red-lead with our <hi>Lytharge,</hi> and make as much or more Money of it; and none can make better Red-lead, or cheaper than we, for our <hi>Lytharge</hi> is almoſt Red-lead in its own nature; it wants only grinding and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, and the work is done, whereas others are at much greater Charges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>But you can't vent all your Lead in <hi>Lytharge</hi> or Red-lead; What will you do with the reſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>We can vent a great deal that way; and the reſt we can ſell either in Lead, as others do; or elſe refine it, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101819:27"/>take out the Silver and then reduce it into Lead again, which we can do to good profit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>But is your Lead reduced, as good as the other? for it's ſaid that ſuch Lead is not ſo good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>That is a Vulgar Error (my Lord) for we find by Experience that our Lead is the better, and indeed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the General Rule in all Caſes of Metals, that the oftner it is refined in the Fire, the purer the Metal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Then certainly it is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to refine all your Lead, if your Silver turn to any account. Pray Sir, what is your Profit by the Silver?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, It is not always the ſame; but ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>What is the Reaſon of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I'le endeavour to explain it to your Lordſhip; but I muſt firſt put you in mind of a Common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſlitting a Groat with Sulphur or Brimſtone ſet on fire, and if you continue the fire to it, it will turn the Silver Groat to a black Duſt, which can never by any Art be reduced into Silver again. So that Sulphur (it ſeems) is a great Enemy to Silver, and being melted together in the fire, deſtroys the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101819:27"/>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>I remember that Experiment very well; but what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this Silver-oar abounds with Sulphur, and in the Smelting of it in the Fire, the Sulphur deſtroys a great part of the Silver, ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, according to the Skill and Care of the Smelter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>If this be the Caſe, I can't ſee how it can be prevented at all, but that the Sulphur will always deſtroy the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, notwithſtanding any Care of the Smelter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, ſome Operators uſe ſuch a Flux and in Smelting the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oar, as imbibes, fixes, or deſtroys the ſtrength of the Sulphur, before it has any great operation on the Body of the Silver; which Flux is not commonly known; and where it is, there is Skill and Care in the very Uſe and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and in the ways and proper ſeaſons of mixing and ſtirring the Oar and Flux (which is a Compound) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And this is the Reaſon that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have more Silver, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs out of the ſame quantity of Lead.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are things I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand before; but I confeſs you have made it very plain to me, that ſuch things
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101819:28"/>may be, by your Inſtance in this common Experiment, which almoſt every Perſon knows to be true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Really my Lord, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has extreamly pleaſed me with this Account of the Matter, for it Anſwers all the Objections founded on the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Yield in Silver, and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons, when they hear that the Oar yields ſometimes more, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, are apt to conclude that it yields nothing at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>There is another great Reaſon which occaſions an uncertainty of our Yield in Silver, which is this; We have ſeveral Ribs of Oar in the ſame Veins, which lye by one another like Planks in a Floor; as for inſtance, in the great Vein, we have Potters-Oar, or Soft-Oar, which is of a large Grain; Starry-Oar, which is of a ſmaller; and Steely-Oar, which is of the ſmalleſt Grain of all; and generally the ſmalleſt grained Oars do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with moſt Silver. But at preſent theſe Oars, being all mixed and ſmelted confuſedly together, we have more or leſs Silver in every Operation in proportion to the quantity of ſmall grained Oars that happened to be in each parcel of Lead refined; and this might be the occaſion that ſome Perſons formerly thought our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101819:28"/>Oar ſo very poor, and others ſo very rich in Silver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>If ſo, methinks you ſhould take care in raiſing your Oar, to keep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſort by it ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>We do intend to do ſo for the future; though it is not improper in ſome Caſes to ſmelt them altogether in a due proportion. But, my Lord, that we do make profit of the Silver, to the advantage of the Nation, as well as our ſelves, is ſo fully and fairly tried and entred in our Books, that there is no room for any Objection in that Caſe, unleſs we can ſuppoſe that all the Gentlemen of the Committee would not only be guilty of a notorious Falſity in their Journals and Leidgers, but alſo pay a fictitious Profit to the Company out of their own Pockets, which would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to imagine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure it would be ridiculous to do ſo: But now you ſpeak of the Committee again, pray do they really buy in, as is affirmed, or ſell out; for I had rather judge of any Man's Opinion of the Mines (that has a knowledge of them) by his Actions, than by his Words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I have particularly examined that Matter, and do find that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee have bought in, and that not any have ſold out any part of their Principal

               <p>Sixteen hundred pounds a year is a vaſt Salary; they may be very generous to him, and yet take time to conſider of ſetting ſome bounds to the Propoſal; as for inſtance, That he ſhall have a Salary of One hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for every Ten thouſand pounds Profit, not exceeding five or ſix hundred pounds a year. I think that is very fair.</p>

               <p>Well, I ſee the Gentlemen of the Committee are honeſt Gentlemen, and ſpeak the truth. I think nothing in the World can be more Convincing. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in all the late Projects that were not founded on an honeſt bottom, the principal Promoters of them ſold out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and their Transfer Books, Journals, and Leidgers were kept private,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101819:31"/>that no Man could tell what they did: But here they not only have ſtood their ground, but laid out more Money; and all their Proceedings are fair and above board.</p>

               <p>Why, my Lord, there are thoſe in the World who ſay that all this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, they very fairly tell us, That the Committee have done this only to put a better Gloſs on the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That's very likely indeed; the Merchants and Lawyers do uſe to throw away ſo many Thouſand pounds only to get another Perſon a good Name, Pray are they old Partners, or new Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>

               <p>Nay, my Lord, here is one thing more that pleaſes me very well; Here is an <hi>Alphabetical Index</hi> of all Letters, and of the Progreſs that has been made in all the Veins, Levels, Adits, and Croſs-Drifts to each Vein, ſo that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may readily ſee an Account of the Mines, and what Oar is raiſed in each Vein, and by every ſet of Workmen, without reading all the Books and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at large, which, my Lord, is a great help to us Men of Buſineſs, who have not always time to be poring over all the Books and Papers at length.</p>

               <p>Pray, Sir, How came it to paſs that you have not in all this time ſet on ſome
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101819:34"/>Engine to drain the Water in the great Work, and raiſe Oar there? for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have often heard this Objection made.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this thing has been ſeveral times under Conſideration before the Committee, and in particular the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of Capt. <hi>Savory</hi>'s Fire-Engine, which I take to be a very ingenious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and deſerves all due Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir; and how chance the Committee did not make uſe of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Not for want of a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Engine, my Lord; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beſt Engines are chargeable, and a Level, when made, carries off the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without any Charge at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, What do you mean by a Level?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, a Level is called in ſome places an Adit, in others a Sough, or Drain, and may be compared to a Common-Shore, carried on from the bottom of the Hill at a dead Level, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, to the further end of it, to Drain off all the Water from the Mines, as they work them, without the help of any Water-Engine, or any further charge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That is very fine indeed. How deep is your Level from the Surface of the Ground?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:101819:34"/>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>In ſome places more, in ſome places leſs, according to the riſe and fall of the Ground; but in the deepeſt place it is Sixty four yards, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>That is a Noble Level to drain Sixty four yards in Oar from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. But How will you ſink a Pit or Shaft down to ſuch a deepneſs to let off the Water?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Miners work from the bottom of the Hill, or Level, on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stages or Stelches one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they come near the Surface, and ſo meet the Shaft, that is ſiinkng down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: But there are many Shafts in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places ſunk down above a Hundred yards deep, and in <hi>Hungary</hi> above Three hundred yards, as <hi>Brown</hi> in his Travels to the <hi>Mine-Towns</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> informs us, when he ſays, That at the Mine of <hi>Chrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits</hi> he went down by the Pit, called by the Name of the <hi>Emperor Rodolphus</hi>'s <hi>Shaft,</hi> gently deſcending by the turning about of a large Wheel, to which the Cable is faſtned, a Hundred and eight Fathoms deep into the Earth; and after many hours being in the Mine, was drawn out again by the <hi>Emperor Leopold</hi>'s <hi>Shaft,</hi> ſtreight up, above Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards; a height ſurpaſſing that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101819:35"/>of the <hi>Pyramids</hi> above a third part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>But their Works perhaps are not ſo much troubled with Water as yours are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>They may not, my Lord; but our Method is very eaſie: For when we have ſunk down as deep as we conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently can for Water, we bore a Hole through the Rock quite down to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and ſo let off all the Water in the Common-ſhore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>That's an excellent way indeed; but pray, Sir, how can you bore through hard Rocks?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we have ſharp Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, skrew'd to Iron-rods, of about Four foot long, which are alſo skrew'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to what length you pleaſe; with which we pounce the Rock into a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and by continually turning about, we keep the Hole round, and with the working of the Water, and motion of the Iron-rod, the Rock or Stone thus beat to duſt, will in great meaſure riſe up to the top of the Ground, and work out of it ſelf; but when the Hole begins to be choaked, we take up the Rods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skrew the Chizel, and skrew on a Borier, with which we cleanſe the Hole, and then put down the Chizel again, and by this means we can bore a Yard
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101819:35"/>in a Day in a very hard Rock.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very fine Invention; you'l make us perfect Miners: But, pray Sir, give me leave to ask you, Whether it would not be worth your while to uſe ſome Water-Engine in the mean time, till your Levels can be brought home?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>If the Committee did believe that it would be long before thoſe Levels could be brought home to the Veins, I doubt not but they would make uſe of ſome Water-Engine; but the Reaſon which ſweyed with them to defer the uſe of ſuch Engines a little longer, was this, (as I am informed) Their Shaft ſunk down in the great Vein (which is now fall'n in) was about Twenty nine or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yards deep, and having carried on the Work in a Drift under Ground about Ten yards or more near to a Bogg, the Water thereof, and the ſmall Stream which runs through the ſame, came in ſo faſt into this Drift, that they were not able to withſtand it without a very great Charge; and they are of Opinion, that it will require ſeveral Engines to draw off ſo great a quantity of Water; the Charges whereof, and of placing the ſame under Ground, and of ſinking more Shafts for that purpoſe, and repairing the old Shafts and Drifts, and the Wages
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101819:36"/>of Men to work the Engines, will (by the Computation of what has been done and actually practiſed in other Mines) amount to a very conſiderable Sum of Money, when perhaps by that time theſe Engines ſhall be made, the Shafts ſunk and made fit to receive them, the Engines carried down and placed to Work, the great Levels, Adits or Soughs may be carried home to the ſeveral Veins, and thereby the Water drained off without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Charge, and no farther uſe made of all thoſe expenceful Engines. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ſuch Engines are neceſſary, and very advantagious to all Works, that have not this great advantage of Ground, as we have, to make a Level to drain off the Water: Yet in our particular Caſe the Committee did conceive that it would not be very acceptable to the General Meeting, that they ſhould expend out of the Trading-ſtock any conſiderable Sum on that account, or (at leaſt) that an Affair of this Nature did require farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>The Committee do well to be ſaving of the Stock: But, pray Sir, why could not the Committee raiſe Oar in the Levels, and alſo with the help of theſe Engines at the ſame time, to pay all theſe Charges?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:101819:36"/>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe I doubt the Partners would not be pleaſed to pay Forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Tun, or ſome other great price, for raiſing Oar with Engines, when they will be able to raiſe Oar enough in the Levels for Five or Six ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tun.</p>

               <p>That's a good Reaſon indeed, and I am glad this Objection was thought off, becauſe many Perſons argued from hence, That this great Vein was only a Belly of Oar and worked out; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (ſay they) the Partners might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently raiſe Oar with the help of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but you have fully ſatisfied me in that matter.</p>

               <p>That Objection has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly anſwered; A Belly of Oar being Ten, Twenty, or Thirty, (but none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fifty yards in length, but this Vein has been found for ſeveral Hundred yards, and all the parallel Veins in this Mountain ſhew this to be a miſtake. But, my Lord, the Committee (who are in great Expectation of coming up ſhortly with their Levels to this great Vein) do yet intend (if any Accident ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to delay them beyond the Time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) to make uſe of a Water-Engine, which will immediately demonſtrate this to be a ſettled Vein.</p>

               <p>Pray, Sir, what is the longeſt Time propoſed to carry the Level home to the great Vein?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> (the Steward) in his <hi>Eſſay</hi> on the value of the Mines, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to have a Years time to ſet the Works in order, and carry up the Levels to Oar in the reſpective Veins, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires the latter end of <hi>May</hi> next, being juſt a Year from the time he went down to the Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I thought he had propoſed it much ſooner; I am ſure I have heard ſome Perſons ſay ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I remember that an eminent Counſel being charged with giving an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that did not hold good in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> asked the Gentleman where he gave ſuch an Opinion, for he did not remember it, nor could he find his Name in his Book of Fees; <hi>No,</hi> ſays the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>but if you remember, Sir, I met you on the Road between</hi> Worceſter <hi>and</hi> London, <hi>and put this Caſe to you. That might be indeed,</hi> ſays the Lawyer, <hi>had you no more wit than to try your Cauſe upon a Travelling Opinion.</hi> So I doubt this might be a ſudden Opinion from Mr. <hi>Waller:</hi> He is a Sanguine Man, and ſuch Men are apt to believe what they mightily wiſh for; and yet I fancy he never gave ſuch
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101819:37"/>an Opinion, but with his uſual Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in caſe the Rocks under Ground did not prove harder than they were at that time: But ſince they did, and to ſuch a degree of hardneſs, that whereas the Miners then made good Wages upon a Bargain of Thirty ſhillings a Fathom, they can now ſcarce make their Wages at Six pounds a Fathom. I think we ſhould be as hard upon him as the Rocks are, if we ſhould tye him up to more than he deliberately propoſed in his <hi>Eſſay.</hi>

               <p>Truly I think ſo too; and he does very fairly, if he keeps that Time; for I ſeldom knew a Maſter-builder that promiſed to build a Houſe in a Year, ever finiſh it under two, ſome unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or other frequently falls out (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Expectation) to delay the Work, though at laſt he may finiſh a very ſtately Pile of Building, and give very good Content.</p>

               <p>Your Lordſhip obſerves very well: But in this Caſe we have reaſon to believe Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> will uſe his utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, becauſe his Salary is to ariſe out of the Profits of the Mines. And I find by his Letters he has a good heart ſtill; he tells the Committee, That if they'l have a little patience, he doubts not but to ſhew them <hi>Welſh Potozi</hi> more glorious
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101819:38"/>than they expect, or he ever promiſed.</p>

               <p>Conſidering all Circumſtances, how deeply he adventures himſelf, and how he ſtill ſtands his ground, I muſt confeſs I can't but think he believes he ſhall make a great Thing of it; but yet I perceive many Perſons do not fancy thoſe high Expreſſions; I think his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds a year for every Share, did him no great kindneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>That Matter has indeed been the moſt expoſed by our Adverſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Town of any thing; for many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taking things upon common Fame, without reading over the <hi>Eſſay</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals</hi> at large, really thought that the Adventurers were to have Forty pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for every Share preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado; whereas Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> did only write an <hi>Eſſay</hi> on the value of the Mines, (not a poſitive Valuation,) and there offers to the old Partners (with all due ſubmiſſion to better Judgment) his Opinion thereof; together with his Reaſons at large for the ſame, that they might themſelves Judge of the Validity of them; by all which he does indeed ſeem to demonſtrate to my poor Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that in time, with a large Stock, and good Management, the Mines may be brought to an extraordinary great value;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101819:38"/>and then it's obſerved, that at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt valuation every Share will be worth Forty pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> poſitively declares in the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his <hi>Eſſay,</hi> (pag. 6.) <hi>That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected one year to put the Works in order, and even then (though a conſiderable Profit might be made) yet he did not pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome years more to bring the Works to the higheſt valuation;</hi> that is, to Forty pounds a year for every Share. But what he means by <hi>(ſome years)</hi> I cannot tell, nor I believe he can but gueſs himſelf, for all that depends on Accidents under Ground, and on the Management by the Partners. But here is nothing that could lead any rational Perſon, that read this Book, into an Expectation of having Forty pounds a year preſently.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>No certainly: But is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the other Propoſals that could lead the World into this miſtake?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, it is ſo far from that, that all thoſe Papers, even the printed Liſts at the Drawing, (where the Publiſhers that agreed with the Clerks for the Copy put it in, to make the Liſts ſell the better for their own Profit) all refer to the ſaid <hi>Eſſay;</hi> and although Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Valuation was very proper to be taken notice of upon ſuch an Occaſion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101819:39"/>yet the value of the Mines in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the <hi>Mine-Adventure</hi> is expreſly ſet <hi>at leſs than a fourteenth part of Mr.</hi> Waller<hi>'s Calculation,</hi> which perhaps is as much too little as the other is thought too great.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>That was very cautiouſly done indeed, and ſufficient to prevent ſuch a Miſtake; but if Perſons will buy an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and never look over the Writings, 'tis their own fault, if they expect more than they ought. But, pray Sir, will nothing leſs than Forty pounds a year preſently for every Share ſerve their turn, How much is that <hi>per Cent.</hi> profit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Forty pounds a year at Ten years Purchaſe for a Leaſe of One and twenty years is worth Four hundred pounds, and I think a Share was valued at that time at Twenty pounds, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and at that rate the gain from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Share muſt have been Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for every hundred pounds adventured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>A very modeſt and reaſonable expectation, eſpecially for ſuch Perſons who were to run no hazard in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, for even the Unfortunate (it ſeems) were to be repaid their Principal Money adventured, with Intereſt at Six pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, we have no room for more to work, till our Levels and Croſs-drifts are carried home to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Veins; for we employ as many Men as can ſtand to work in every place, and we change them every eight hours, day and night, which is all that can be expected in this Caſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Very well; But when your Levels are brought home to the Veins, then I ſuppoſe you'l employ double the number of Men preſently.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>We ſhall employ more Men to be ſure; but I cannot tell how many. But this I conceive I may venture to ſay, That at the end of the Year, after the Levels are carried home, we ſhall be able to employ double the number of Men in raiſing of Oar, to what we ſhall do at the beginning of the Year, for we ſhall be making more Stages or Stelches for Men to work upon every Month.</p>

               <p>That is my Notion of the Matter, my Lord, I can't ſee how it can be otherwiſe; but I do not pretend to make ſuch an exact Calculation, that the Profit ſhall be juſt double to a Farthing; but thereabouts, or ſomething near the

               <p>I will, my Lord; and becauſe I'le keep within compaſs, I'le ſuppoſe that every two Miners ſhould raiſe no more than one Tun of Oar in a Week, (which they actually did when they worked downwards with Gad and Sledge, and raiſed the Oar without a Level, by the help of a Water-Engine.) Theſe Men at this rate, and accounting but Forty working Weeks in the Year, will raiſe Forty Tun a Year, and then the Caſe ſtands thus: <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>I think you have gone far enough; for if you make but Five pounds Profit for every Tun of Oar one with another, according to the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal thereof by this Computation will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Fifty one thouſand and two hundred pounds every year, which is a vaſt Profit to all the Adventurers. But, pray Sir, why can't any other Perſons that are Propietors of Mines do the ſame thing as you propoſe to do, and then they'l raiſe as much Oar, and make as much Profit as you can?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>If they have as many Veins <hi>in number, as large, as rich, as near the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, with as deep a Level at each end of the Hill, and as near the Sea as ours, and alſo as large a Stock as we have,</hi> they may raiſe as much Oar, and make as much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: But I confeſs, I could never yet read or hear that any part of the Chriſtian World hath ſuch Veins as theſe, with all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages aforeſaid; and if they want any of them, they will be at a loſs; for ſome Veins are ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> that the Miners can't raiſe the <hi>Oar</hi> without cutting the <hi>firm ſides</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, and then perhaps two Miners can't raiſe a Tun of Oar in a Month or more, Other Veins are ſo troubled with Water, that three parts of four of the Time and Labour of the Workmen is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101819:43"/>ſpent in keeping the Water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can raiſe but little Oar. Others again have ſo ſhallow a Level, that they can't erect many Stages one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for any great number of Men to work upon. And ſome are ſo far from the Sea, that they can't poſſibly get Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for any great quantities of Oar, and moſt private Perſons want ſo great a Stock as is required to all manner of Charges in ſuch Caſes. On the other ſide, the <hi>Mine-Adventurers</hi> have all the Advantages that poſſibly can be deſired; but I am not for carrying the thing to its higheſt value at firſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>However, let us venture to double the Men once more for our own private Satisfaction, to ſee what the Profit will be then: Hold, let me conſider, you will then employ One thouſand twenty four Men; truly that's no ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary number of Men in ſo many Veins, I know a ſingle Vein, not above two Foot wide, which employs Six hundred Men; but theſe Men at the ſame rate will be able to raiſe Twenty thouſand four hundred and eighty Tun of Oar in a year, and conſequently the Profit at Five pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun will be One hundred and two thouſand and four hundred pounds a year; I proteſt, I can't tell what can be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101819:44"/>ſaid againſt this, nor why you may not double the Men again, and make as much more, ſuppoſing the Facts be true, that you have ſuch large Veins.</p>

               <p>I am not for terrifying one part of the World, or amuſing the other with great Calculations; though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I can't ſee at preſent where the End of our Profit will be, with alarge Stock and a good Management, and therefore as I am not for raiſing the Mines to too high a value, ſo I am not for leſſening the true value of them, and thereby diſcouraging the Partners, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do not miſtake, and expect that Profit preſently which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſome years hereafter: And this Caution being carefully obſerved, I muſt then own, that as to the Matter of Fact, a great part thereof has not only been atteſted by many Perſons of ſeveral Ranks and Qualities upon Occular view, but ſome Perſons of Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have made Affidavits thereof; and though we are not now capable of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much in the great Vein as in the old Partners time, by reaſon the Shafts ſince they left off working were fallen in, and the Works drowned with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet we can ſtill ſee ſo much at the Surface of the Ground, as gives very
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101819:44"/>great Satisfaction to all thoſe that are skill'd in Mineral Works, for they ſee plainly, that there are ſeveral Veins bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oar at the day near the Surface, betwixt firm and ſolid Sides. And whatever may have happened in other Counties, where they have generally Bellies of Oar, or where the Veins do lye betwixt Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Sills, or Sides, or where the Sills do often change; yet I am fully ſatisfied by Information from the old Miners in that County of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> where all the Veins lye between Rag-ſtone-Sills, or Sides, without changing the Sills, that it was never known in all the old Silver Mines of Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> the famous Mr. <hi>Buſhell,</hi> and all the Patentees of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mines,</hi> that any ſettled Vein (as theſe are) in the County of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> which did bear Oar at the Surface of the Ground, did ever fail or miſcarry at the bottom of the deepeſt Level they ever made; but on the contrary, they were always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to grow richer and better, as they were worked lower and deeper.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101819:45"/>ſuch a thing may be; for if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his great Craft and Cunning, ſhould go down to the Mines, and not apply to the Steward, he might come up to Town almoſt as ignorant as he went down.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord, they lye in a Bogg, and the Water muſt be drawn off, with Tubs or Buckets, even in the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Croſs-Cuts or Shafts, before any Man can ſee the Ribs of Oar that lye ſo near the Surface of the Ground.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Then it is not unlikely but ſome Perſon or other has thus made a Miſtake, and loſt his Labour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, you have forgot to take notice, that the upper Level to the Bogg Vein is carried home, and that the Oar in the ſaid Vein does ſet well, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens downward, ſo that we are paſt all doubts about that Vein, which I hope will be ſufficient alone to repay us our Principal Money with Intereſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>All this is ſet forth by the Committee in the printed <hi>Abſtract</hi> of the State of the Mines, and it proves a very rich Vein. Nay, ſome very skilful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of Opinion, that it will prove
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101819:45"/>as rich as that we call the great Vein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bears as good Oar near the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and widens downwards, as well as that did; and I hope that ſingle Vein will anſwer much more Profit than what you are pleaſed to mention.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Queſtion ſeems to be, not whether you ſhall gain or looſe by this Undertaking? but how much you ſhall gain? For, that is all that is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Pray, Sir, how many Veins have you in all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Eight, my Lord; Six of Lead, and two of Copper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>That is a great advantage to have ſo many Veins lye together, where one Level will ſerve to drain the Water from all or moſt of them. If you can employ but One hundred Men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently raiſe Two thouſand Tun of Oar in each Lead Vein, (one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) you will gain at that Rate about Sixty thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> But beſides, the Committee gives a very good Account of one of the Copper Veins.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>The Copper Veins are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled Veins between firm Sides, and rich in Copper; but at what deepneſs they will gather to a Body of Oar, is yet uncertain; they have a promiſing Aſpect, and are very large Veins, and in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101819:46"/>one of the Croſs-drifts which takes moſt Ground upon it, we meet with rich Strings of green Copper Oar, which gives great hopes that that Vein will prove quick in that place, and bear a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of good Oar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>On, my word, if that ſhould ſo happen; That one Copper Vein may be worth all the Lead Veins, Copper being above One hundred pounds a Tun, and Lead not above Ten or Eleven pounds.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Here is great Expectations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But, pray Sir, how much Oar do you really believe you ſhall be able to raiſe the firſt year, after the Levels are carried home to the Veins?</p>

               <p>Your Lordſhip may gueſs by what has been ſaid already; but 'tis not poſſible yet to give any certain Account thereof, till the Works are ſet in order, and full Trials made of all the Veins.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I can but gueſs at it; for it may be the Workmen will not raiſe ſo much as I think they will, and it may be they will raiſe a great deal more.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I hope they'l be able to raiſe at leaſt One thouſand Tuns the firſt year after the Levels are up, if not more; which may be done by Fifty Miners, or there abouts, at the Rate aforeſaid.</p>

            <p> So that it appears that in Caſe we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy but Fifty Miners the firſt year, yet in Five years after the Levels are carried home to the Veins, we are likely to raiſe One hundred fifty five thouſand pounds, and thereby to repay every Adventurer his Principal Money adventured with Intereſt at Six pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> to a very ſmall matter.</p>

               <p>Then, my Lord, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have made liberal Allowances for all theſe Accidents already; for when your Lordſhip conſiders that a Tun of Oar lyes in the compaſs of two Foot ſquare, or thereabouts, and that two Men in blaſting upwards with Gun-powder, will raiſe more Oar than ſix Men in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards with Gad and Sledge, your Lordſhip will not think it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable for two Men in one of theſe large Veins, to raiſe a Tun of Oar in a day, whereas I have ſuppoſed that they will raiſe but one Tun of Oar in a Week.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>If a Tun of Oar lyes in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a compaſs, and your Works are once brought into ſuch an Order, that you can work upwards from the Level, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Blaſt of Gun-powder will bring down more than a Tun of Oar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>It will either bring it down, or ſo crack the Load of Oar, that with Iron Bars two Men will preſently pull down a Tun of Oar.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>And then, I preſume, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can make a Blaſt in a Night and a Day, that is, in Twenty four hours.</p>

               <p>My Lord, a great Heap of Oar above Ground lyes in a little room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Steward, who has experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced how much Oar he has raiſed in a Yard ſquare, has computed at his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Valuation, that the Mines can't be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted during our Term to the deepneſs of our Level; which your Lordſhip will the eaſier believe, when you conſider that the Mine of <hi>Chermnitz</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> has laſted Nine hundred and fifty years, and that the Mine of <hi>Potozi,</hi> not above Six foot wide in any place, has laſted from the Year 1546. which is about One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty three years, with Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men at work. And <hi>Zenophon</hi> upon the Silver Mines of <hi>Athens,</hi> tells us, <q>That
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101819:51"/>as they dug on, they ſtill diſcovered freſh Veins; and though their Mines had been wrought for many Ages with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Hands, yet they continued ſtill ſo far from being drained or exhauſted, that they could diſcover no viſible difference in their then preſent ſtate of the Mines from the Account their Anceſtors had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to them; and when they had moſt Labourers at work at the Mines, they found they had ſtill Buſineſs for more Hands then were employed.</q> And Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> acquaints us, <q>That all great Veins of this kind are in ſome reſpects like a great large ſpreading Oak, and hath a great number of Branches, which like Boughs of a Tree, ſhoot forth from the Body of the Vein, inſomuch that after a conſiderable Sum of Money ſhall be gained out of the ſame, and many Years ſpent in the working thereof, there will be ſtill diſcovered freſh Veins ſhooting forth from the ſides thereof, which are innumerable, and ſcarce ever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</q>

               <p>My Lord, we muſt then place a Water-Engine with a Wheel in the great Level, and turn the Water-courſe that runs through the Bogg in Troughs, down one of the Shafts upon the Wheel, and ſo by that means drawing off the Water from the Mines, we ſhall raiſe the Oar Forty yards deeper than the Level; or elſe we may uſe Captain <hi>Savory</hi>'s Fire-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for that purpoſe, which we find beſt.</p>

               <p>Now you ſay ſomething; then indeed if you can raiſe Oar ſo much deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Level, I believe there will be no want of Oar; for Forty yards in Oar for Twelve hundred yards in length in ſo many Veins, will be a vaſt Addition: Pray Sir, caſt it up in the great Vein.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I will, my Lord. Let me conſider; If a ſolid of two foot ſquare in Oar will yield one Tun, how many Tuns will a Vein Twelve hundred yards in length, Two yards in breadth, and Forty yards in depth yield? Anſwer, Three hundred twenty four thouſand Tun; which being valued at Five pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, amounts to One million ſix hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand pounds: Is not this a fair Profit from the Oar below the Levels? But I will abate One hundred and twenty thouſand pounds for Twitches and Faults
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101819:52"/>in the Vein, though there is not uſually ſo many at that deepneſs as near the Surface; and I have ſuppoſed the Vein but Six foot wide, though we have had it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Seven foot ſix inches, and in all probability will be much broader at that deepneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>If you can raiſe ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, what vaſt quantities may be raiſed above the Levels? which in ſome places is Sixty four yards deep from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No, my Lord, the Company conſiſts of ſuch Perſons who have Shares, and they who have Blanks are only Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the Mines, but have no Vote in Elections, or Intereſt in the Capital Stock.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>The Shares (as ſoon as the Blanks are once paid off) will have a conſiderable dividend, and be advancing every Year towards the higheſt valuation of Forty pounds <hi>per</hi> Share, which is a prodigious Profit above the Rate they were firſt ſold, as I have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and in the mean time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors thereof have the management of the Mines; are entituled to a Capital Stock of Twenty thouſand pounds at the end of the Term, and to all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which ſhall be procured in the mean time, in the Reverſion of theſe, or in the Purchaſe of any other Mines, free from the Incumbrances of Blank Tickets, or any other Payments, and when it's conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Improvements have been made already in ſo ſhort a time in Smelting and Refining, and what may be made before this Term will be expired, I don't know but a Share in this Company, may by that time be advanced to as high a degree (in proportion) as the New-River-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, which I think did advance from One hundred pounds a ſhare to Three thouſand pounds or more, where it now continues.</p>

Mines are not ſo much wanting in this Kingdom as Money and Management; Private Perſons are generally ruined by ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, which are too big for them, and a private Perſon will get more by a moderate Part or Duty of a Mine clear of all Charges under the Management of ſo great a Company, than by managing

               <p>How! Eight hundred Partners, that is a great Number indeed; if you get One hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds a year, that is but Two hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> one with another, which is very inconſiderable.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>A vaſt loſs indeed; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the particular Profit to the King (though ſmall) might be greater before the Act, then ſince.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord; I do really think that his Majeſty will in a few years, when theſe Works are brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, gain more by the very Cuſtoms of Lead ſince this Act, then his Majeſty and all his Royal Predeceſſors from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt did from <hi>Royal Mines</hi> themſelves before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Nay then, if the King and his People are all Gainers by this Act, it was certainly a very happy Law for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>It was ſo; and I think it's plain that every Law that Enriches the People, enriches the King, ſince his Wealth muſt ariſe from theirs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true; and this very thing proves what an inſeparable Union there is betwixt the Intereſt of the King
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101819:56"/>and his People; for whilſt their Intereſt in the Caſe of <hi>Royal Mines</hi> was divided, neither King nor People could get any thing by them; but now their Intereſt by this Law is united, both will be great Gainers.</p>

               <p>But, my Lord, there is one thing more to be conſidered in this Caſe, that may prove of vaſt Conſequence to his Majeſty and his Royal Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>

               <p>This gracious Act of <hi>Royal Mines</hi> has quite altered the Scene of the Mineral World; for before, every Man that had an Eſtate or Intereſt in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, endeavoured to conceal their Mines, but now they all labour to find them out, and therefore it is not unlikely but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other, one of thoſe conceal'd Mines, or ſome other, may be ſound out, and prove ſo rich in Silver, as may be worth his Majeſty's acceptance at the price propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the late Act concerning <hi>Royal Mines,</hi> and one ſuch Vein would be an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſure to his Majeſty, and his Royal Succeſſors.</p>

               <p>It would ſo: And the way to promote ſuch a Diſcovery, is to Encourage thoſe that Unite together in a Joint
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101819:57"/>Stock for the working of Mines: But, pray Sir, why did the People of <hi>England</hi> ſo very much oppoſe the Patentees, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conceal their Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe the Proprietors thereof were to have no advantage by them, nor the leaſt ſhare of the Profit; but on the contrary, their Lands were torn up to the very Bowels, and covered with Heaps of Rubbiſh, and High-ways were made over their Corn and Paſture Land, without paying any Conſideration for the ſame, to the great Grievance and Oppreſſion of the Subject.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I live in a Level Country where no Mines are, and never ſaw any of theſe hardſhips committed on the Subject; but it is no wonder the Patentees of <hi>Royal Mines</hi> could make no great Profit, when it was the Intereſt of all the Country to oppoſe them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, they did not only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in general, but the Miners and the Country People did make them pay ſawce for every particular thing: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we carry on our Works for a third part of the Charge that it coſt the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>How! that's a vaſt Advantage indeed; Then it ſhould ſeem that the People are not averſe to the Thing, but to the Perſons.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I don't apprehend that they were averſe to the working of Mines, nor to the Perſons of the Patentees; but to the leaſt intruſion into their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and to the damnifying their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates by any Perſon or Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the People of <hi>England</hi> were always averſe, and I believe ever will be.</p>

               <p>Truly I can't blame them; but what do you do to oblige them more than the Patentees.</p>

               <p>There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt their Proceedings and ours, for they came without asking leave, by a great Power and Authority, and without paying any Conſideration for the Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs done to their Eſtates: But we are called in by Conſent and in Aid of the Proprietor; paying a valuable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for what we have.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That is a great difference in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But by their calling you into their Aſſiſtance, I perceive the Proprietors don't care to work their own Mines without Partners.</p>

               <p>My Lord, there is no working Lead-Mines or Copper-Mines without a large Stock; and it's generally obſerved that two or three Sets of Adventurers are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101819:58"/>either ruined or totally diſcouraged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mines can be ſet in order, and bring in Profit, as it happened in the Caſe of theſe very Mines. There were two Setts of Undertakers diſappointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Company was Eſtabliſhed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Oar appeared at the day near the Surface of the Ground, and two or three ſmall Stocks, to the value of Six or Seven thouſand pounds, were raiſed and ſpent in carrying up the Levels, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Smelting-Houſes, and in other dead Charges, without the leaſt return of clear Profit, which has ſo opened the Eyes of the private Proprietors of Mines, that they will not venture on them now without a good back to ſupport them.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>They do very wiſely; and therefore its plain that Mines can never be wrought effectually for the Publick Good of this Kingdom, but by Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Men; for few or no private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, though of great Eſtates in Land, are able to raiſe ſo great a Stock as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in theſe Caſes.</p>

               <p>Your Lordſhip is certainly in the right of it; and therefore I conceive (with ſubmiſſion) that it is for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of this Nation that ſuch Companies be Encouraged, for thereby <hi>his Majesty will not only make a certain profit in his

               <p>In his <hi>Introduction</hi> theſe are the words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Land is to yield the Product, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101819:59"/>Product is to yield the Wealth, ſo that we ſhould enquire how this product ſtands in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Particular, but more eſpecially in the principal conſtituent Parts of</hi> England's <hi>Strength, namely Wool, Corn, and our Mines, for 'tis by the well ordering and wiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe Branches of our Wealth, that we are to be Gainers in the Ballance of Trade.</hi> And in Page 94. after he has treated of the Land of <hi>England,</hi> and the Product thereof, of ſeveral kinds, he goes on in theſe very words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Mines are the Product of the Earth, and undoubtedly capable of great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we ought to reſpect them as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of our Trade, and which made us known to the firſt Merchants of the World, the</hi> Phoenicians. <hi>We have Tinn, Lead, Copper, Calamy, Iron, Coal, Culm, Allom, Copperas, with other ſorts of Minerals; and what is in this manner dug out of the Earth, can't be a leſs Article then about Seven or Eight hundred thouſand pounds</hi> per Annum <hi>in the whole Rental of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who work theſe Mines, and deal in Minerals, know beſt what Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions they want to make their Buſineſs more eaſie at home, and to give their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities a free vent abroad; but if they need any help from the Legiſlative Power, moſt certainly they ought to have it, ſince
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101819:59"/>their Stock and Labour turn ſo much to the Common Good, for whatever their Product yields in Foreign Markets, is clear National Profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are lately publiſhed ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Accounts of the Mines in</hi> Cardigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, <hi>where 'tis ſaid there are Eight large Veins of Silver, Lead, and Copper Oar, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near together in one Mountain, nigh a Navigable River and a good Port.
<note n="*" place="margin">Mine-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, p. 7.</note> 'Tis alledg'd that theſe Mines with a large Stock, in a few years, may be advanced to a clear Profit of One hundred and ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds</hi> per Annum. <hi>This Computation does not ſeem at all extravagant to thoſe who have look'd into the Accounts of what Mines produce in other Countries, provided the Oar be good, the Veins like to laſt, (and large ones ſeldom fail) and provided there be no invincible Impediment from Nature to their working; they have ſtood ſtill ſeveral Years for want of a good Agreement among the Adventurers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis ſaid Sir</hi> H. M. <hi>has put them in a way of being wrought; but if his Expectient ſhould not ſucceed, and if new Differences ſhould ariſe, the Legiſlative Authority, may very well and juſtly interpoſe, even to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Partners to ſome Agreement, whereby the Work may be carried on; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101819:60"/>due to the Publick, at no time to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a few Stock-jobbing Citizens to ſtand in the way of any National Advantage, the Fraud and Corruption of which ſort of Men have hurt</hi> England <hi>in more than one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe Mines come but any thing near the value Mr.</hi> William Waller <hi>has put upon them, and with reaſons very probable, they are a fit object of the States care; and upon inſpection into their true worth, if private Purſes can't raiſe a Stock ſufficient to ſet them going, it were better done upon ſome publick Fund, to be repaid out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, than to looſe what is repreſented as ſo immenſe a Treaſure. But ſhould it prove leſs, 'tis not to be neglected, for Nations (like private Men) who will thrive, muſt look into ſmall things as well as great; and for this we have the Examples of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>whoſe Miniſters examine into the minuteſt Matters, where the Publick may poſſibly reap any Advantage; and 'tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commendable piece of Wiſdom, were it but for this ſingle reaſon, that to do ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, begets a habit of Care and Diligence in things of higher importance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus (my Lord) you ſee what this ingenious Gentleman ſays, who hath made it his Buſineſs to enquire into Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101819:60"/>of this Nature; he does not think the higheſt Valuation of theſe Mines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, provided the Oar be good, the Veins like to laſt, and there be no invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Impediment from Nature to their working; but it's proved before, that the Oar is good, and that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear its laſting, and that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels being carried home, and thereby the Water carried off, there can be no Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment from Nature to their working.</p>
               <p>And then he is ſo ſenſible of the great Advantages that may accrew thereby to the Nation, that rather than ſo immenſe a Treaſure ſhould be loſt, he ſeems to think it reaſonable that the Parliament ſhould lend the Partners a Stock to carry it on, to be repaid out of the Profits; but ſince by the Aid of many new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers they have at laſt, with great difficulties, raiſed a ſufficient Stock them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are willing to run all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ſo great an Undertaking for the publick Good of the Kingdom, as well as for their own particular and private Advantage, it can never be doubted, but that his moſt gracious Majeſty, and all our Noble Senators and Patriots of their Country, will be ready to give this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking all the Encouragement that it is capable of.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>All the Partners who have three Shares have a Vote in a General Meeting, and all who have ten Shares in a Grand Committee, and the Select Committee is elected every Year at a General Meeting, out of thoſe Partners who have Twenty Shares.</p>

               <p>Then you will do well to take care that they be not only honeſt Gentlemen, but Men of Temper and Conduct, fit for Buſineſs, and ſuch as have a conſiderable Intereſt in the Mines. But what is the Power of the Grand Committee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>The Grand Committee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to eaſe the General Meeting of any trouble, unleſs upon extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: But now the General Meeting, having agreed to meet every ſecond <hi>Thurſday</hi> in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> there will be little or no Buſineſs for the Grand Committee.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That is certainly the beſt way; for there are many honeſt Gentlemen that will be diſobliged, if their Friends Vote againſt them, though they are not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for doing the Company ſo much Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as others in a Buſineſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and all the Partners are to reſpect the Publick Good in theſe Caſes, and not any Private Friendſhip.</p>

               <p>Yes, there is my Lord; for they may ſend up a Letter of Attorney to <hi>A. B.</hi> and in his abſence to <hi>C. D.</hi> and in both their abſence to <hi>E.

               <p>All this is very well provided: But has every Partner as many Votes as he has three Shares? Then the Mines in time may come into the management of a few rich Perſons that ſhall engroſs all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord, there is too great a Truſt repoſed in them to be depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any others; all the Treaſure of the Company is in their keeping, and under their management, and no Perſonal Truſt

               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>That is very true; you ought indeed to be very careful of your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that it be not waſted or imbezel'd. Pray Sir, how do you keep your Stock, does it lye dead by you in a Cheſt?</p>

               <p>No, my Lord, this Matter ſtands thus: If the value be above Five thouſand pounds, the Order, Bargain, or Agreement muſt be made and ſigned in Writing, under the Hands of Seven of the Committee, and if above the value of Ten thouſand pounds, or be to continue above a Year, then it is to be confirmed by the Grand Committee or General Meeting.</p>

               <p>There is this farther to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That all Material Bargains, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Agreements relating to the ſaid Mines, are to be ſigned by thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Committee that make them, that in caſe of any miſmanagement, it may not be truſted to an Entry by the Book-keeper only, as is uſual; but it may alſo appear under their own Hands, who were the Authours of it.</p>

               <p>They have Twenty ſhillings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them at every Meeting, and no more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>No! that is very little indeed; in other Companies they have Twenty ſhillings, or more, apiece; but this is not Two ſhillings each, if they all appear.</p>

               <p>Each Party pays a Shilling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Stamp; that's all.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is a very cheap Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to paſs an Intereſt of ſeveral Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds value for a Shilling: But can they convey their Intereſt away to each other by no other Conveyance, but by a Transfer and Acceptance in thoſe Books in the Office.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Then it is very clear that they muſt comply with their own Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But are their Tickets of no force or

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>There was not room to write more upon the Tickets, but it was ſuppoſed that every Perſon would read the Settlement of the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> which ſhews that thoſe Tickets did enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Bearer to ſo much, according to the Limitations in the ſaid Settlement, that is, until the Drawing was over; and Regiſters made, and ſigned by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers; together with the ſaid Transfer Books; but afterwards there is not the leaſt regard to be had to theſe Tickets, only that by them any Perſon may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whether he has had Juſtice done him by the Accomptant to the Company, that is, whether his Intereſt in the Mines be truly ſtated and entred in the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>As much as any Perſon has in the like caſe in the <hi>Bank of England;</hi> he may have a Certificate or Copy of the Transfer from the Office, where it is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, which is ſufficient.</p>

               <p>Very well, I am ſatisfied; for he has a Certificate or Copy of the Transfer, and the Security of two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, beſides ſeveral Journals and Leidgers and their Duplicates, to prove his Title; But, pray Sir, what is the manner of Summoning a General Meeting?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>A General Meeting muſt be ſummoned by hanging up a Publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof in writing on the firſt Pillar on the right hand near the South-gate of Entrance into the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and at the uſual place of Meeting, a Month before the time appointed. This is all that is required by the Settlement: But there is generally further Notice given in the News Papers; but now every Perſon may take notice of Courſe that they have agreed to meet every ſecond <hi>Thurſday</hi> in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>November.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>As many as will make up (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) One thouſand Shares; but any leſſer Number may meet purſuant to notice, and adjourn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I think this is well ordered, for that is ſuch a Number as may probably meet together to do Buſineſs, and is alſo ſufficient to prevent any Surprize upon the Company: But ſuppoſe a Perſon that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101819:67"/>has a great number of Shares ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them into ſeveral Hands, on purpoſe to make a majority of Votes; ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign may be of ill conſequence, and I don't ſee how you can prevent it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>For this Reaſon every Partner is obliged, if required by the Chair-man, or any ſix of the Partners, to make a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Affidavit before a Maſter in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> that he hath three Shares in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meeting, and ten Shares in a Grand Committee, and twenty Shares in a Select Committee, in his own Right, and not in Truſt for any other Perſon, or elſe he is to have no Vote.</p>

               <p>Certainly there cannot be any thing more fair or better managed: But
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101819:73"/>is there no way to deceive you of ſome of the Silver?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is a very hard matter; for firſt, we Eſſay every parcel of Lead on a ſmall Teſt, to ſee how much Silver it holds in a pound; then we ſtand by the firſt Trial in the great Furnaces, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine very carefully the yield thereof, by which we know what all the reſt muſt afford to a ſmall matter. Beſides, there are many Men employed together in one Work-houſe, who muſt all combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and forfeit their Obligations, or elſe they can't deceive us.</p>

               <p>Well, Sir, I ſee you are in ſuch a Method, that you are not eaſily to be impoſed upon. And ſince I perceive it is the Opinion of wiſe Men, that it is not improbable but that your Mines may in time anſwer Mr. <hi>Wallers</hi>'s Calculation, I deſire to know (if that ſhould happen) what Addition will be made every year in Silver to the General Stock of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I am always for the Publick Good as much as I can; and after ſo long and expenceful a War, I ſhould be glad to hear that the Nation was like to be repleniſhed every year with a good Stock of <hi>Welſh Bullion;</hi> ſuch a thing as this would fall out very happily, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101819:73"/>providentially for this Kingdom; and would be diſcountenanced by none but thoſe that are Enemies to their Country, or at leaſt prefer their own private gain before the Intereſt of the Publick.</p>

               <p>There have been of late great Improvements made in the Iron Trade by the ingenious Major <hi>Hanbury;</hi> and alſo in the Smelting and Manufacturing of Lead by ſeveral others; but that which would be moſt valuable and advantagious to this Nation, <hi>viz. The Art of Separating of Silver from Lead,</hi> is not yet brought to its higheſt Perfection. The <hi>Mine-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,</hi> by the Aid and Ingenuity of Mr. <hi>Robert Lydall,</hi> have made the faireſt ſtep towards it; for that Oar which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Artiſts in the Kingdom could not Smelt and Refine to any Profit at all, it is moſt certain they do; whereby, I doubt, we have raiſed the Envy, and conſequently the Oppoſition of ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Ingenious Refiners, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may think it a Reflection on their Ingenuity, that any Improvement ſhould be made in that Art by any other but themſelves. But this Failing being ſo very common and natural to Mankind, ought eaſily to be excuſed; and we have been ſo very tender of their Reputation (whatever they have been of ours) that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101819:74"/>we have not pretended to Extract much more Silver out of a Tun of Lead than they did, and for that we have given a Reaſon, becauſe the Oar in ſinking deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grew better and richer then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo that their Sincerity in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Trials is freely owned and confeſs'd. But there being a great difference betwixt Refining of Silver, which is properly their Buſineſs, and Extracting of Silver out of Lead, which is properly ours; they may not have thoſe Opportunities and Conveniences of making Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Improvements in the latter, as we have. Beſides, there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt their way of Extracting, and ours, in reſpect of the Charge, for they do it with Wood, and we with Pit-coal; they in <hi>London,</hi> where all things are dear, and we in a Country where all things are cheap; they do it from Oar which coſts about Four pounds a Tun at their Mills, and we with Oar that coſts about Twenty ſhillings.</p>

               <p>I am glad you have any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that may encourage you to proceed in <hi>the ſeparating of Silver from Lead;</hi> becauſe it is plain, that how little Profit ſoever you may make, all the Silver extracted is clear gain to the Nation; ſo that in caſe you
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101819:74"/>extract no more than Five pounds out of a Tun of Lead, and the Charges of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it amounts to Four pounds ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, whereby the Profit to the Company is no more than Ten ſhillings in a Tun, which is very inconſiderable; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will gain the whole Five pounds, which is conſiderable, and may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a vaſt Revenue, if you have Encouragement to extract the Silver out of great quantities of Oar. And therefore I deſire to know what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will get at that rate, in caſe the Mines ſhould ever be advanced any thing near to Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Calculation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Nation would gain above One hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> as your Lordſhip may eaſily compute from the Calculation in Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Eſſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>How! That will be a great Advantage to this Kingdom indeed; you need not fear Encouragement from all good Men and true Lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as ſoon as the Nature of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is known to the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, my Lord, be pleaſed to conſider that the Nation does not only get by the Silver extracted, but alſo by the Lead, Lytharge, and Red-Lead; which being Exported out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101819:75"/>will Import their full value in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities, without carrying our Coin and Bullion out of the Nation; and if our <hi>Exports</hi> are of greater value then our <hi>Imports,</hi> the Ballance of Trade is gained.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>You obſerve very well; and it is the undoubted Intereſt of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>to Export as little Silver and Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and as much of our own Commodities as we can, in order thereby to gain the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade:</hi> Which is the great thing we have always labour'd for in <hi>England,</hi> and the only thing that can make this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly great and powerful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>But beſides all this, it may not be improper to obſerve what a Chain of advantagious Conſequences to the Nation will attend ſuch an Undertaking as this; How many Hundred (if not Thouſands in time) of Men, Women, and Children will be employed? The Men in raiſing, winding up, and ſtamping; the Women and Children in dreſſing and waſhing the Oar. How many Men and Horſes in carrying the ſame to the Water-ſide? How many Sail of Ships will be employed in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oar to Coal, and Coal to Oar round the South-Coaſt of <hi>Wales?</hi> How many Seamen to Man all thoſe Ships? what numbers of Men will be employed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101819:75"/>in building and making all Materials for the Rigging of ſo many Ships with Sails, Maſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in Repairing the ſame; in loading and unloading the Veſſels; and many other ways that are too nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous now to be mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe will be conſiderable; as we find by experience in the Trade of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Coal, which has all theſe Conſequences, to the great Advantage of the Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Coal had a beginning ſome time or other, as well as this Undertaking; I deſire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to tell me, whether you believe that any Man that ſhould at that time have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an Eſtimate of what did afterwards come to paſs, how many thouſand Men, and what vaſt number of Ships and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be employed in that Trade, to the great Advantage of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether at that time his Account thereof would not have ſeem'd as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Eſſay on the value of theſe Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Sir, I believe it would; and therefore it muſt be confeſs'd, That Undertakings of this Nature ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Encouragement imaginable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may conduce very much to the Publick Good if they ſucceed; and if
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101819:76"/>they do not, they can do none any hurt, but thoſe that are concern'd in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Such Men in other Countries are eſteem'd Publick ſpirited Men, and it is the Wiſdom and Policy of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers always to aſſiſt and encourage them, and I doubt not but they will be encouraged here, when they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. But this is a new Undertaking, and unfortunately timed, in an Age when all new things are called Projects, and condemned without a hearing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas well timed in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for Lead is grown a ſcarce and dear Commodity, and many Veins of late have failed in other Countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>I think we are all now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that you are engaged in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking that is likely to be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Publick as well as to your ſelves, as ſoon as the Works can be fet in order, and brought to perfection. And therefore I deſire to know, firſt, <hi>What are the Difficulties you meet with;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>What Laws and Conſtitutions you want to make your Buſineſs more eaſie at home, and to give your Commodities a free vent abroad.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that ſuch an Undertaking as this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101819:76"/>muſt meet with many Difficulties, or elſe what occaſion had there been for joyning ſo many Purſes together, and raiſing ſo great a Stock.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Your Lordſhip obſerves very well, that all great Undertakings do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meet with great Difficulties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do require Time and great Purſes, as well as Care and Conduct to bring the ſame to Perfection. But this is little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by thoſe who condemn this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for delay, when I really think that no Undertaking hath ever gone on better for the time than this has done, or met with fewer Difficulties. Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> went down to the Mines the latter end of <hi>May</hi> laſt, and what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences hath been erected and made at <hi>Neath</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire</hi> for Smelting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining, and Carriage of our Goods, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the <hi>State of the Mines,</hi> ſet out by the Committee, doth ſufficiently ſhew; as alſo that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſince that time hath erected convenient Houſes to Entertain One hundred and fifty Miners, on that barren deſolate Mountain where the Mines lye; that the conſtant and punctual Payments hath encouraged the Country to bring Proviſions to them; that the Works have been carried on Night and Day, with freſh Men every eight hours:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101819:77"/>And although Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> never propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his <hi>Eſſay</hi> to ſet the Works in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der under a Year, yet he is now working in Oar in the Bog Vein, and does expect to be raiſing Oar in many more places before the year is expired; and had not the Rocks proved exceſſive hard, which is all the difficulty we have hitherto met with, we had in all probability carried our Levels to Oar in many places before this time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, you have now put me in mind of a great difficulty indeed; for ſome are ſo confident, as to ſay, that the Rocks are ſo very hard, you will never be able to get through them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>No! that's hard indeed; but, my Lord, it's plain we have got through them in ſome places, and that we have got into the heart of them in many other; ſo that they are not unconquerable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>But does not this Difficulty much diſcourage you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, not at all; for it is a conſtant Obſervation amongſt all Miners, that <hi>the harder the Rock, the richer the Mine;</hi> Nature generally makes the <hi>Caſe,</hi> ſtronger or weaker, according to the richneſs of the <hi>Treaſure</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; for wherever the ſides of a Vein are crack'd and broken, the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101819:77"/>that feeds the Vein, runs off, and the Vein proves dead, or very poor: But when the ſides of a Vein are ſolid and firm, without cracks, the Mineral Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der impregnates and enriches the Mine, and the ſame proves quick and rich in Oar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>What you ſay is very rational, I confeſs; but yet from the hardneſs of the Rocks there is a great delay and loſs of time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, with humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, I can't allow that any time is loſt, that we never propoſed to ſave: I own, that if Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> does not get through theſe hard Rocks by the latter end of <hi>May</hi> next, as he propoſed, then we may be ſaid to looſe all the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>May;</hi> and yet if the Veins do happen to prove at laſt much richer than he propoſed, it will be no loſs at all, but an Advantage.</p>

               <p>I muſt beg leave on this occaſion to take notice, that I have obſerved all along in this Undertaking, a very great and particular Providence, beyond what is common and ordinary in other Caſes; I have had an account, by how many ſtrange accidental Occurrences theſe Mines came to the knowledge, and afterwards to the management of thoſe Perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101819:78"/>whoſe Hands the firſt part of this Undertaking did ſo wonderfully proſper. It was not without admiration that I ſaw ſo many Perſons of different Parties, Sexes, and Intereſts amongſt the old Partners, entirely agree to refer all their Controverſies and Law-Suits to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Perſon that was a meer Stranger to them, when the diſſent of any one Member had deſtroyed the whole Undertaking; I ſay, the ſight of that Grand Settlement of the <hi>Mine-Adventure,</hi> ſigned and Sealed by ſo many Perſons of different Qualities and Intereſts, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed over the whole Kingdom, did not raiſe in me a common or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Notion of the thing. Neither was it without ſome wonder that I beheld ſuch an Undertaking ſet forth in the dead time of a Long Vacation (when the Town was empty, and many monied Men gone into the Country) to proſper to ſo high a degree, that Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he never ſaw ſuch crowding for Subſcriptions before; That new Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, of all Ranks and Qualities, ſhould agree in the ſame Opinion about it; Lords, Biſhops, Members of Parliament, Divines, Merchants, and Lawyers in all Parts of the Kingdom: That all things that ſeem'd at firſt to be an obſtruction,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101819:78"/>even the very Differences in the Family of the Proprietor, tended at laſt to the promoting of it: And therefore, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I am inclined to believe that even this particular Accident of the hardneſs of the Rocks, will alſo (ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) tend to the Advantage of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kertaking.</p>

               <p>I confeſs there has been ſeveral remarkable Paſſages in this Undertaking, and beſides what you have mentioned, the drawing of it ſo very fair, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating ſo conſiderable a part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to Charitable uſes, the Eſtabliſhing ſo good a Conſtitution, the management of it with ſo much Care and Exactneſs in relation to the Accounts, and with ſuch Frugality as to the main Stock, the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proſecution of the Works, and the great Purchaſes ſo lately made by the Committee; all this induces me to have a very good Opinion of the Undertaking, that it is founded on an honeſt Bottom, and that it will be proſperous in time: But I confeſs, I can't underſtand how the hardneſs of the Rock can tend to the Advantage of the Undertaking, unleſs by keeping in the Mineral Feeder within the firm ſides, and ſo making the Veins richer, as that Gentleman has obſerved.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101819:80"/>Do you want no help from the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>There is no Company ſo great, but the Legiſlative Power is able to make them greater; but at preſent I don't know of any thing that we have to deſire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Majeſty and the Parliament ſhall think fit to paſs an Act to ſave the Lives of ſome Criminals condemned to Die for leſſer Offences, and order them to be Tranſported over <hi>Severn</hi> to work in the Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I thank you for that Thought, certainly there is nothing could redound more to the honour of a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than ſuch a Law, whereby the Souls of many Thouſands of Men may by the Grace of God be eternally ſaved, as well as their Bodies, from utter ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>But beſides the Charity of ſuch a Law, there is no ſmall Policy therein; for thereby the Nation would reap the benefit of their Labour, and the poor penitent Criminals be able to make ſome Atonement for their Crimes in the Service of their Native Country.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>What you mention is a Law that all good Men would be very well pleaſed with, but that we have got ſuch a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101819:80"/>horrible Notion in <hi>England</hi> of Slavery, that I doubt ſuch a Law will never be carried in our Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, my Lord, I am of your Opinion; I believe it would never admit of a Debate; the very Title of ſuch an Act to make Engliſh-men Slaves, would be ſufficient to throw it out of the Houſe upon the firſt Motion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly beg leave, with all due ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips, to diſcourſe this Matter a little farther, I humbly hope your Lordſhips (however) will not throw it out without Debate, nor be offended with me for offering my poor Thoughts on this Occaſion to your Lordſhips Conſideration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>No, good Doctor; Pray go on Sir, and ſay what you pleaſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I preſume that our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Engliſh Patriots are not angry with <hi>meer Words or Sounds,</hi> but with the Thing it ſelf called <hi>Slavery;</hi> that is, they abhor that Abſolute and Arbitrary Power which is uſed in other Countreys of condemning Men to the Gallies for leſſer Offences; but I can't think they do abhor the ſaving of an Engliſh-man's Life, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die. That which is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is not to make Engliſh-men Slaves that are entitled to Liberty; but, on the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101819:81"/>contrary, to ſave condemned Criminals (that have forfeited their Liberty) from the Slavery, both of Sin and Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld.B.</speaker>
               <p>But you would ſtill make them Slaves to work at the Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I would ſo; but they are firſt dead in Law; they have forfeited their Birth-right; they are no longer Engliſh-men; they are condemned by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to die; their Blood is Attainted, and the Law has no farther tenderneſs or regard for them. Can any Engliſh-man be in fear of ſuch a Law? No certainly; If he commits no Offence worthy of Death he is in no danger: if he does, he will be glad of ſuch a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, to ſave his Life, to have time to Repent, and to live among Chriſtians in his own Country, where he will have a Chaplain to take care of his Soul, as well as a Keeper of his Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld.A.</speaker>
               <p>I proteſt the Doctor diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es very well in this Caſe; If Men would have patience to hear this Matter fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, I can't think but they would have another Opinion of ſuch a Law then now they have; for (as the Doctor obſerves) the Thing we fear, is, That in Caſe of Miſdemeanors, or other ſlighter Offences, inſtead of Fine and Impriſonment, or any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101819:81"/>other uſual Corporal Puniſhment, the Judges ſhould have power to condemn an Engliſh man to any ſort of Slavery, which would be of ill conſequence, for we are tender of our Liberty: But where there is no danger of looſing our Liberty, till a Man is firſt condemned to die, and hath forfeited his Eſtate, Liberty, Life, and all, I think that alters the Caſe very much; for this is to add Liberty to an Engliſh-man, not to take it away, ſince there is more Liberty in any Life, than in the dark Regions of Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, my Lord, I think ſuch a Law could never be more ſeaſonable then at this time. Our late War has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off many thouſand Mens Lives, the Country want Men for their neceſſary work of Husbandry, eſpecially in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time, and if another War ſhould happen the King would want Souldiers; and therefore for all Felonies and Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenies without Benefit of Clergy, (except Treaſon and Murder) I think ſuch a Law would be of great advantage to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as I ſhall indeavour to demonſtrate to your Lordſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>'Twould be a great advantage to your Mines perhaps; but I don't know whether it would be ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101819:82"/>to the Publick, to have a Neſt of Rogues in the Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Hard Labour will in time bring down the higheſt Spirits; and with God's bleſſing and good management in a Chriſtian Country, may bring them to a ſenſe of Religion and Vertue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, though I propoſe ſome advantage to the Mines by this Law, yet I propoſe more to his Majeſty and the Publick, if your Lordſhip pleaſe to hear me out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I'le hear you very patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any thing for the advantage of his Majeſty and Publick, therefore pray go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I propoſe that the <hi>Mine-Adventurers</hi> ſhall pay an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to his Majeſty for every ſuch Criminal; that is to ſay, Whereas a Workman in that Country may deſerve Nine pence <hi>per</hi> day, I would divide that Nine pence into three parts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, Four pence <hi>per</hi> day to maintain the Criminal in Meat and Drink, Three pence <hi>per</hi> day to his Majeſty, and Two pence a day to the Company for Clothes and other incident Charges; whereby his Majeſty would have an Annual Rent of Four pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> and upwards for each Criminal; at which rate One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Criminals would yield above Four
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101819:82"/>thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and Ten thouſand Criminals above Forty thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> This is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Income; and in all the Mines of the whole Kingdom ſo many Men may eaſily be employed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>I proteſt I am brought over; I like this Motion very well; and I can't tell how far this Thought may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to many other purpoſes, as well as to the Mines, and bring in a very great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and thereby become very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Publick, and very agreeable to the Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>But how would you be able to govern ſuch a multitude of Men, and keep them in good order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>What has been done, may be done: Nay, what is now actually done in <hi>Hungary</hi> and other places, may I hope be practiſed in this Kingdom. If once there was a diſpoſition to ſuch a Law, I preſume it would not be difficult to pen it ſo, as to provide againſt all Objections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: and if <hi>England</hi> ſhall get but the Moiety of what is got by ſuch a Law in <hi>Hungary,</hi> it would pleaſe both the King and Parliament very well. The Mines in <hi>Hungary</hi> bring in a vaſt Revenue, and are worked by condemned Criminals, or elſe they could not get a farthing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:101819:83"/>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, I queſtion whether this Puniſhment would be ſo great a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to Offenders as Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I preſume it will be a much greater Terror to Offenders; for though when Death approaches and looks them in the Face, when the Terror of an Evil Conſcience, and Fears of greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another World, mortifies their Spirits, and daunts their Courage, they would perhaps much rather work at the Mines, and have time to repent, then take a ſudden Leap in the Dark, under all thoſe Horrors and Amazements of a guilty Soul; yet when Men are in the Vigour of their Youth, when their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are high, their Courage bold and daring, and they are brought to great Neceſſities and Want, and thereby grow deſperate, and are inveigled and drawn in by ill Company, to a lewd and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſe of Life, they generally cry out for <hi>A merry Life and a ſhort one;</hi> they then look upon Death with an Atheiſtical Eye, without any Senſe or Horror of Puniſhment in another World, and the pain of Hanging appears to be ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and ſo ſhort, that it cauſes no great Terror to them: But the Thoughts of being perpetually condemned to ſuch hard work as the Mines, where they will
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101819:83"/>be ſure to do all the moſt ſlaviſh, and aborious work; Men that are uſed to Plenty and Eaſe will be extreamly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with ſuch a Thought more then can be imagined; it will ſeem as terrible to them as to be hanged every day, and yet not to die and be eaſed of the pain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. A.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, you have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, I really believe it would be much more terrible: But however, becauſe it is a new thing, I ſhould think it very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable that ſuch a Law ſhould be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary at firſt, and then there can be no danger in making a Trial of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, my Lord, I am ſo very tender of propoſing any thing that ſhould be inconſiſtent with the Liberty of the Engliſh Nation, that I ſhould humbly propoſe that ſuch a Law ſhould be ſo penn'd, that for fear of any the leaſt Inconvenience, it ſhould ſtill be in the Election of his Majeſty, either to let ſuch Criminals ſuffer Death according to the uſual Judgment paſſed upon them, (which ſhould ſtill be the ſame as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, without alteration) or elſe (inſtead of Tranſportation to the <hi>Indies</hi>) to grant them a Reprieve for working at the Mines, and then the Criminal, being uncertain which Puniſhment might be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, would be under a double Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101819:84"/>both of Death and of the Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>Now you have made the thing ſo clear to me, that I can ſee no manner of Prejudice by it, firſt to make ſuch a Law Temporary, then that the Judgment be ſtill the ſame, <hi>quod ſuſpendatur per Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, &amp;c.</hi> and only a Power granted to his Majeſty in Capital Offences of a leſſer nature, (inſtead of Tranſportation) to grant a Reprieve (not a Pardon) for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Majeſty receiving ſuch an Annual Rent for every ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal as aforeſaid, whilſt in health and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to work; there can be nothing ſaid againſt this in my judgment.</p>

               <p>Truly, my Lord, I think ſo; unleſs <hi>Hanging</hi> be a Priviledge inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But what if a Criminal grow ſickly and unable to work, how ſhall he then be maintained?</p>

               <p>This was the Contrivance of our Steward, Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> that has drawn us all into this Undertaking; and this of ſaving of condemned Criminals to work at the Mines is my poor Thought, which I humbly ſubmit to better Judgment.</p>

               <p>A little more time will open the Eyes of the World, and ſet this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in its proper Light; but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it will now be very agreeable to theſe Noble Lords to propoſe an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, for I doubt we have ſo tired
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101819:86"/>their Lordſhips patience, that they will never care to hear any more of Mines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this long Diſcourſe.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. B.</speaker>
               <p>You have had our Opinions of that already, and it's plain that it wants nothing to bring it into the higheſt Eſteem but to be underſtood; it is a new thing, and really ſome that are concerned with you, can give but an indifferent account of the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Your Lordſhip has hinted at the true Reaſon for that, becauſe it is a new thing, and very different from other Undertakings, though they at firſt ſetting up might be as difficult to be underſtood as this; which being entangled by Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt the old Partners, could not be reduced to any effectual Method and Order without large Settlements, and a New Conſtitution. But I hope your Lordſhips underſtand it now pretty well.</p>

               <p>I humbly thank your Lordſhips, I hope ſo too: I know what the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and moſt other Countreys uſually do, on ſuch Occaſions, to encourage Adventures of this Nature; and I doubt not but we have many wiſe and honourable Perſons in this Kingdom, who underſtand and wiſh well to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good of this Nation, and will not willingly ſuffer any private Intereſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, where the Publick is concern'd.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion from the Precedent Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>THus you ſee the Nature of this Undertaking fully explain'd and ſet forth; and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the drawing of Lots, hath been of late abuſed to ill purpoſes, and therefore diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, yet in this Caſe it was not only allowable, but abſolutely neceſſary, and the means of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a conſiderable Gift to charitable Uſes. And that the <hi>Mine-Adventure</hi> was drawn with all the fairneſs and exactneſs imaginable, to the entire ſatisfaction of all the Adventurers. You ſee the ſincerity and good intentions of the firſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers fully demonſtrated; That they have in all reſpects dealt very juſtly and honourably by all the Partners concerned. You ſee with what exactneſs the Accounts of this Company are kept. What care and pains hath been taken in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and eſtabliſhing a Conſtitution for the better management of the Mines, for doing Juſtice, and preſerving Peace and Unity amongſt all the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. You obſerve what progreſs has been made, both in the effectual working of the Mines night and day, and in the ſmelting and refining of the Oar raiſed from the ſame, and what a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit above all Charges is made thereby, and that this is done with all the good husbandry and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that an Undertaking of this Nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. You may alſo perceive that we are not like to want <hi>Oar</hi> during our Leaſe, nor freſh Mines to employ our Stock at the end thereof. You ſee all the Objections fully and fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and how falſe, frivolous and malicious many of them were: You will from hence be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101819:88"/>better able to judge of the intrinſick value of theſe Mines, and what credit ought to be given to the future Reports and Cenfures of malicious or ſelf-deſigning Men againſt this Publick Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. You may alſo obſerve in what proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Annual Profits of theſe Mines will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably increaſe for ſome years, and conſequently by what ſteps and degrees they will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advancing towards the higheſt valuation; and thereby you will the better know <hi>how to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance your Expectations, and give your preſent and future Intereſt their juſt weight.</hi> You will alſo take notice from what has been diſcourſed, how much Undertakings of this Nature may in time conduce to the publick good of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in particular towards gaining the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade; eſpecially ſince the higheſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of theſe Mines does not ſeem improbable to Men of judgment, who have look'd into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of what Mines produce in other Countries.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is with all humility and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better judgments conceived, that the Nature of this <hi>Adventure</hi> being thus explained, it will not be very much for the honour or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any true Engliſhman to oppoſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch an Undertaking, where the Advea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to do any prejudice, but may do a great deal of good to this Nation.</p>
            <p>However, ſince it appears that the intereſt of his Majeſty and the Publick is ſo much concern'd, and that not only the Poor of <hi>Greenwich-Hoſpital</hi> but of moſt of the great Corporations and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs in <hi>England,</hi> will reap advantage front the proſperity of the <hi>Mine-Adventure.</hi> It can't be doubted, but that our moſt gracious Soveraign,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101819:88"/>and our Noble Senators and Patriots of their Country, will readily condeſcend to give it any aſſiſtance and encouragement, which they in their great Wiſdom and Goodneſs ſhall hereafter from time to time judge requiſite and proper; whoſe gracious Smiles and favourable Countenance will ſoon diſperſe thoſe thick and dark Clouds of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and private Intereſt that over-ſpread this lower Region.</p>
            <p>And it is humbly hoped, that amongſt all his Majeſties great and glorious Actions, it will be no diſhonour to the preſent Reign, nor to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Members of both Houſes of Parliament, that the glorious Act concerning Royal Mines, (that open'd a new Scene of conceal'd Treaſure to this Kingdom,) was paſſed in their time; nor that theſe Mines were the firſt occaſion, and this Undertaking the firſt good Effect of that happy Law; eſpecially when it is obſerved, that by the Induſtry of the <hi>Mine-Adventurers,</hi> ſome Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall every day be made to the Publick Stock of the Nation in good Bullion, extracted out of our own Mines, and conſequently in time many Millions of good Sterling ſaved to this Nation, that was before totally loſt, and in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enjoyed by Foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>'Tis humbly hoped that it will be no diſhonour or prejudice to this Nation to improve the growth and manufactures of our own Country; not only by extracting the Silver out of Lead, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, but by making Lytharge of Silver as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a Commodity as our Lead it ſelf, out of which it is made (to our ſhame) in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>This Undertaking is yet in its infancy, but if it has the honour to he protected in its juſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101819:89"/>Rights, and nurſed up by the Legiſlative Power, with the uſual care that is generally afforded to all other the Natural Products of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is not doubted, but the Fruit thereof will in a reaſonable time redound very much to their Honour, as well as to the Profit of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>How many great and wonderful things are often brought to paſs from very ſmall and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable beginnings, is obvious to all that either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any time in reading what is done abroud, or obſerving what is acted at home; and it is not impoſſible, nor perhaps improbable, but ſome Men now in being may live to ſee this Company of the <hi>Mine-Adventurers</hi> bring in more real intrinſick and ſubſtantial Profit to this Nation then any other Company whatſoever. However, this is moſt certain, that they will have no occaſion to carry any Silver or Bullion out of the Kingdom, as others do, and that they will always Trade in Staple Commodities, that import their full value into <hi>England.</hi> It's no very eaſie matter to judge of ſome Companies (though they make great Gains to themſelves, and vaſt Sums of Money do circulate through their hands) whether the Nation gets by them or not? but it's certain, that all that is gain'd and expended by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, brings in a clear National Profit; for their very Expences (as well as Gains) circulate in our own kingdom, and at the ſame time raiſe the Materials of a Staple Commodity out of the Earth, that employ great numbers of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, in the Manufacture thereof, and is all <hi>an Addition to the General and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Stock of the Nation.</hi>

               <head>Mr. Waller <hi>to the Committee in theſe words following,</hi> April 23d. 1700.</head>
               <p>SInce mine of the 16th. I began a Shaft eight Yards <hi>North</hi> of the new Work, and on the point where the large Sparks of Oar is got at ſeven Yards deep. But here at three Yards deep in this new Shaft we ſtruck upon the Quick Vein, ſo that the bottom of it is, as if it were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with good Potters Oar, and we have got no ſide of it, ſo what widneſs it will reach till I ſee the ſides, I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you; we raiſed Oar of all ſizes, from a Stone to 200 weight, and ſome ſo large we could not remove till our Shaft is Timbered; this is what I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for in mine of the 2d. of <hi>April,</hi> I told you we were going upon the riſe of our Sills, ſo that I doubt not but we ſhall reach here where it will take its ſet, for here the Oar is gathered into one body, and is raiſed within three Yards of the Surface.—</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101819:95"/>
               <p> We are Sumping and driving in the new Work in good firm, mixed hard and ſoft Oar, and the Spar-rider con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to under cut in Oar. I intend a Croſs-drift from the New Shaft bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which will be eight Yards, and will clear the new Work of Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine Yards deep —</p>
               <p>I told you in mine of the 9th. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> that I was begun to ſink at (e) in the <hi>Weſt</hi> Level; we are got about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Yards deep, and there we are come to Oar, it is not yet in a firm Rib, which a little ſinking will bring it to.</p>
               <p>We raiſe more Potters Oar out of the Great Work than formerly. It grows ſofter the deeper we go, and our <hi>Weſt</hi> Level will come thirty Yards under our Soles, ſo that it may be much ſofter at our Level; however, we can raiſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when our Levels comes up, as faſt as we pleaſe, or as faſt as it can be drawn.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weſt</hi> Level is not ſo hard as it was, we have no other alteration in any part of our Works.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101819:95"/>
               <p> As to raiſing of Oar, I have done what was poſſible in the Winter Time, the Water being ſo ſtrong upon us, that we were not able to ſink down our Sumps till the Weather grows Warmer, that the Men may be able to work naked in the Water; But as ſoon as <hi>Curtis-Drift</hi> is driven home, and a Sump ſunk into the Level, and a few Stages made, I ſhall quickly make you amends. I have ſuch a glorious Sight before me, that I am in the Condition of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and am reſolved to work Night and Day till I have cleared the Works of Water: But I hope, Patience will not be ſo great a Task now your Victory is in Proſpect, as it was before. We have lately raiſed Oar in ſeveral Places, but till I have raiſed greater Quantities, did not think it worth while to dreſs it up and weigh it; for when the Works are in Order, and the Water Conquered, I ſhall then raiſe more Oar in one Day, than I can now in one Month.</p>
               <p>I have all Hands fully employed, and want more: And though, to pleaſe you, I do now raiſe Oar before the Works are in Order, yet you will have more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from what is left, than from what is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101819:96"/>now raiſed before the Levels are up.</p>
               <p>Gent', I beg your Pardon for this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Letter, and hope you will believe me.</p>
